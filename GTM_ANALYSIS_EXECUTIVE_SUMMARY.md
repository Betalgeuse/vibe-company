## SCORING BREAKDOWN

### Export Compliance Lite (27/30)

```
Model A (PLG): 8.5/10 (Strong fit for expansion)
  ✅ Price point ($4-12K) = PLG sweet spot
  ✅ Buyer is tech-savvy (expects self-serve)
  ✅ Quickcode/KYG Trade proving model works
  ❌ Compliance tools have lower conversion than workflow tools
  
Model C (Self-Serve): 9/10 (Ideal for primary GTM)
  ✅ Tech companies prefer self-serve signup
  ✅ Freemium entry (<$500/mo) lowers friction
  ✅ Fast time-to-value (HS classification in <1 week)
  ✅ Founder effort minimal post-launch
  ❌ Product must have excellent UX (non-negotiable)

Hybrid Bonus: +9.5 average = 27/30
```

---

### Supplier Risk Platform (24/30)

```
Model B (Founder-Led): 8/10 (Only viable option)
  ✅ Supply chain buyers need human guidance
  ✅ $5-15K ACV supports founder-led math (20-30 deals/year)
  ✅ 2-4 week sales cycle achievable
  ✅ Consultative selling builds trust
  ❌ Founder becomes sales bottleneck
  ❌ Scaling requires hiring sales person (adds cost)

Model A (PLG): 5.5/10 (Wrong buyer type)
  ✅ Freemium gap exists
  ❌ Supply chain managers (40-50 yo ops) ≠ self-serve users
  ❌ Compliance = risk; self-serve feels risky to buyers
  
Model C (Self-Serve): 4/10 (Market rejected this)
  ❌ Buyers want to talk to human first
  ❌ Complex onboarding requires back-and-forth
  ❌ All competitors use founder/sales-led model

Single Model: 8/10 → 24/30
