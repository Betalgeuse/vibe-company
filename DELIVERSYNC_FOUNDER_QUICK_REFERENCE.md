## Your GTM in 1 Sentence

**Founder-led outbound sales to VP Operations at 10-50 person consulting firms, with 60%+ trial-to-paid conversion, scaling to hybrid model at Month 6.**

---

## Your 12-Month Timeline

```
JAN/FEB (Month 1-2):    Setup: Build ICP list, landing page, cold email templates
MAR (Month 3):          First customer closes (after 10-week sales cycle)
APR-MAY (Month 4-6):    Scale to 6 customers, $72K ARR, hire BDR
JUN-SEP (Month 7-10):   Hybrid model, close customers 7-12, $120K ARR
OCT-DEC (Month 11-12):  Final sprint, hit $150K ARR with 12-15 customers
```

**Milestone:** If you close 1 customer by month 3, you'll hit $150K ARR by month 12. This is achievable.

## Your Weekly Time Commitment (Months 1-6)

| Activity | Hours/Week | Goal |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Cold outreach (LinkedIn/Email) | 6 | 50-100 messages/week |
| Discovery calls | 5 | 5-7 calls/week |
| Demos | 4 | 3-4 demos/week |
| Trial onboarding/follow-ups | 3 | 3-4 active trials |
| Admin/tracking | 2 | Spreadsheet, metrics |
| **Total** | **20-25/week** | Sustainable for 6+ months |

**Note:** This is achievable without burning out. Key: batch activities (demo days 2x/week, not scattered).

---

## Your ICP (Who You're Selling To)

**Primary Buyer:**
- Title: VP Operations, Operations Director, Finance Manager
- Company size: 15-50 people (sweet spot; 10-200 is acceptable range)
- Industries: Management consulting, accounting, agencies, IT consulting
- Pain point: Spending 10+ hours/week on manual timesheets + billing

**Secondary Champion:**
- Title: Project Manager, Senior PM
- Role: Uses tool daily, influences buying decision

**Disqualify Immediately If:**
- ❌ Using Kantata and loves it (switching cost too high)
- ❌ Company size <10 or >500 (out of scope)
- ❌ No budget this year (waste of time)
- ❌ CEO decides tech (long cycle, unlikely to sign)

---

## Your Outreach Formula (Simple & Proven)

### Step 1: Build Target List (Week 1)
- Use ZoomInfo, Apollo, or Clearbit
- Export: 500 firms matching your ICP
- Columns: Name, Title, Email, LinkedIn URL, Company, Size

### Step 2: Write 3 Outreach Templates

**Template A (LinkedIn Message):**
```
Hey [Name], I noticed [company] scaled to [size] recently. Building PSA for 
firms like yours to eliminate manual timesheets. Thoughts? Quick call?
```

**Template B (Cold Email Subject):**
```
Question about [company]'s project billing
```

**Template B (Cold Email Body):**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long does month-end billing close take at [company]?

Most firms I talk to spend 5+ days consolidating spreadsheets + manual invoicing.

Built a tool to cut that to 1 day. Curious if worth a 20-min call?

[Your Name]
```

**Template C (Follow-up After No Response, 5 Days Later):**
```
[Name], following up on my note about project billing. Easy 20-min call 
if it resonates. Otherwise no worries.
```

### Step 3: Execute Outreach (Weeks 3-12)

**Weekly cadence:**
- Monday-Wednesday: 50 LinkedIn messages (personalized)
- Thursday: 50 cold emails (body personalized, subject templated)
- Friday: Compile responses, schedule meetings

**Response rate targets:**
- LinkedIn: 8-12% response rate (4-6 responses per 50 messages)
- Email: 2-4% response rate (1-2 responses per 50 emails)
- Combined: ~10 responses/week → ~1-2 discovery calls booked

## Your Discovery Call Script (30 min)

### Opening (2 min)
```
"Thanks for jumping on. I'm [Name], building PSA for consulting firms. 
What's your current role at [company]?"
```

### Problem Discovery (10 min)
```
"Tell me about your current process for time tracking and billing."
[Listen for pain: manual spreadsheets, hours spent, errors, team frustration]

"What's the biggest pain point with your current setup?"
[Quantify: hours/week wasted, $$ cost, team frustration level]

"How long does month-end close take you?"
[Target: >5 days = clear pain]
```

### Qualification (10 min)
```
"Are you actively looking for a better solution?" 
[Flag: If "just researching", lower priority]

"What would the right tool need to do for you?"
[Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves]

"Who else should be in a conversation about this? You're the champion—who decides?"
[Identify VP/CFO if not already talking to them]

"If the right tool saved your team 10 hours/week, what would that be worth?"
[Price sensitivity check: >$15K/year = good signal]

"What's your timeline for a decision?"
[Flag: >3 months = likely stalls]
```

### Close (3 min)
```
If qualified: "Here's what I propose: let me do a quick 45-minute demo 
tailored to your setup. Show you exactly how we'd help. Does [day] work?"

If not qualified: "Thanks for your time. If things change, reach out. 
Happy to help."
```

### Qualification Score:
✅ = 4+ of these:
- Admitting manual pain (spreadsheets, hours spent)
- Have budget ($15K+/year)
- Team size 10-200
- Decision cycle <3 months
- Champion identified

❌ = Disqualify if:
- Happy with current tool
- No budget this year
- Wrong company size
- Long decision cycle (>3 months)

---

## Your Demo Script (45-60 min)

### Setup (5 min)
```
"Based on our call, I want to focus on your biggest pain: [THEIR PAIN #1]. 
Here's what I'll show you. Then questions."

[Review discovery notes: What did they say hurt most? Demo that.]
```

### Live Demo (35 min)
Show in this order (not every feature):

1. **Time Entry** (5 min)
   - "Here's how [PM NAME] logs time. Click, project, hours, done."
   - Click through 1 actual entry
   - Key message: "Faster than email, auto-syncs to project"

2. **Utilization Report** (10 min)
   - "At month-end, here's what auto-generates. No manual work."
   - Show team utilization (who's billable, who's admin)
   - Key message: "5-min report vs 5-hour manual spreadsheet"

3. **Billing Integration** (10 min)
   - "All this feeds to QuickBooks auto. No re-entry."
   - Show: Timesheets → Auto-invoice (click once)
   - Key message: "Cuts billing admin by 80%. Fewer errors."

4. **Key Feature (Your #1 Differentiator)** (10 min)
   - Show what Kantata/Float doesn't do well
   - Example: "We auto-calculate project margins. Most tools don't."
   - Key message: "See unprofitable projects before month-end"

### Q&A (10 min)
```
"What questions do you have?"
[Answer objections—see script below]
```

### Close (5 min)
```
"Here's what I'm thinking: Let's do a 30-day free trial. You bring in 
real data, set up your team, see it working. If it's helping, we convert 
to paid. Fair?"

[If yes] "Great. Here's next steps..."
[If no] "What would need to be true?" [Handle objection]
```

### What NOT to Show:
- ❌ Admin panel / full settings
- ❌ Every feature (overwhelming)
- ❌ 10+ screens of clicking
- ❌ Advanced features they didn't ask about

### What TO Emphasize:
- ✅ Time savings (hours/week)
- ✅ Accuracy improvement (fewer errors)
- ✅ Automation (less manual work)
- ✅ Money back (ROI calculation)

## Objection Handler (Your Cheat Sheet)

### "We use Kantata and it works fine"
**Response:**
"Kantata's great for enterprise. You're paying for features you don't need. 
For a 25-person firm, DeliverySync is simpler, faster to implement, 40% cheaper. 
And we'll migrate your data free—zero risk to try."

### "Float is cheaper"
**Response:**
"Float's great for scheduling. But if billing automation is your pain 
(which you mentioned), Float doesn't do it. That's our core strength. 
Worth a 30-day trial to compare?"

### "We need [integration]"
**Response:**
"Good news: We integrate with [common ones]. If you need [specific one], 
most customers use Zapier or our API. I can connect you with someone doing that."

### "Our CEO/CFO needs to approve"
**Response:**
"Smart. Here's what I recommend: 30-day pilot with your ops team. Get real 
results. Then bring to CEO with numbers. Fair?"

### "We're worried about data security"
**Response:**
"We're SOC 2 Type II certified. Here's our security whitepaper. [Mention 
customers similar to them.] Any specific concerns?"

### "Implementation looks complicated"
**Response:**
"For a firm your size, 2-4 weeks. We handle data migration. You focus on 
setup rules. I'll assign a dedicated success manager to guide you."

### "Can you replicate our Excel setup?"
**Response:**
"Honestly? Not perfectly—your setup is very custom. But we automate the 80% 
that's tedious (spreadsheet management, calculations, updates). You might lose 
the 20% custom stuff. Is that worth 10 hours/week saved?"

---

## Trial Success Metrics (How to Close Trials)

**By Day 5:**
- Team invited to DeliverySync
- First 10 hours logged
- One project imported

**By Day 15 (Critical Check-in):**
- Call customer: "How's it going?"
- Target: 50+ hours logged, team actively using
- If NOT: Help troubleshoot immediately. This is make-or-break.

**By Day 25 (Final Push):**
- Utilization report auto-generating (proves value)
- Customer should say "Wow, I can see exactly who's billable"
- If YES → Close conversation: "Ready to move forward?"

**If Trial Flops (<20 hours logged by day 15):**
- This is a PRODUCT issue, not sales issue
- Call customer: "We noticed limited usage. What's blocking you?"
- Don't push to paid. Fix the blocker. Learn for next customer.

---

## Closing the Trial (Trial → Paid)

**By Week 9-10 of Sales Cycle:**

### Conversation:
```
"We've got 1 week left on your trial. How's it going?"

[Listen for positive signals—if hearing hesitation, address it]

"Based on what you've seen, it looks like this is solving your [pain point]. 
Here's what I propose:

Option A: Annual contract, $[lower number]/month (better price)
Option B: 3-month contract, $[higher number]/month (test it first)

Which makes more sense?"

[If objections, handle them—see above]

"Great. Here's what happens: contract signed, we do a 1-hour 
implementation call, assign success manager, you're live. Good?"
```

### Pricing Guidance:
- Lower ACV customers (smaller firm): $15-18K/year
- Mid-market customers (30-50 person firm): $18-25K/year
- No negotiation <$12K (isn't worth support cost)

## Red Flags (Stop & Fix Immediately)

| Flag | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Response rate <6% | ICP wrong or messaging weak | Adjust outreach, sample 10 conversations |
| Demo-to-trial <60% | Discovery not qualifying | Tighten qualification questions |
| Trial-to-paid <40% | Product or onboarding issue | Call 3 churned trials, document why |
| Sales cycle >70 days | Price objection or feature gap | Survey last 3 customers on timing |
| CAC >$6K | Spending on wrong channels | Shift to cheaper channels, improve conversion |

---

## Month 6 Checklist (When to Hire BDR)

If you hit these metrics by Month 6, hire a BDR/SDR:

- ✅ 6+ customers paid ($60-100K ARR)
- ✅ CAC <$5K (validating unit economics)
- ✅ Trial-to-paid 50%+ (product is solid)
- ✅ Demo-to-trial 70%+ (discovery process is strong)
- ✅ Sales cycle 45-60 days (repeatable process)

**If NOT hitting these:** Focus on founder-led sales only. Keep improving conversion before scaling.

---

## Your Playbook Is Now:

1. ✅ Build ICP list + landing page (Week 1-2)
2. ✅ Execute outbound: 50 LI + 50 email / week (Ongoing)
3. ✅ Discovery calls: Qualify ruthlessly (5-7/week)
4. ✅ Demos: Tailored to pain (3-4/week)
5. ✅ Trials: Close to paid by day 25 (60%+ target)
6. ✅ Scale: Hire BDR at Month 6 if metrics hit

**Do this for 12 months. You'll hit $150K ARR.**

---

**Print this. Share with your team. Execute.**

**Start outreach this week. Every week of delay = 1-2 customers lost.**
