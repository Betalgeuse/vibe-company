## 📊 Key Findings Summary

### Overall Verdict
**⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS** (Score: 55/100)

The AI Employee Onboarding SaaS has **viable unit economics** IF:
1. ✅ ACV ≥ $8K (pricing power justified)
2. ✅ Churn ≤ 4% monthly (not <3%)
3. ✅ Competitive moat established within 18 months

**If ANY fail → Business model collapses**

---

### Three Critical Weaknesses

| Weakness | Severity | Impact | Fix Timeline |
|----------|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Churn >4% monthly** | CRITICAL | LTV drops $60K→$18K, LTV:CAC collapses | Q1 2026 |
| **ACV <$8K** | CRITICAL | Revenue ceiling $150K, no growth possible | Q1 2026 |
| **Competitor feature parity Q1 2027** | CRITICAL | 80% TAM becomes commodity, forced pivot | Q4 2026 |

---

### Seven Weaknesses Found (Ranked by Severity)

1. **ACV Pricing Power Crisis** (HIGH) - $12K for onboarding-only vs $7K for full suite
2. **CAC Payback & Founder Labor** (HIGH) - Undercosting labor + cash burn real
3. **Churn Assumption Collapse** (CRITICAL) - <3% is unrealistic, 4-5% more credible
4. **Competitive Displacement** (HIGH) - 18-month window before incumbents add feature
5. **TAM Penetration Reality** (MEDIUM) - ICP too narrow unless expanded
6. **Founder Sales Capacity** (MEDIUM) - 35 customer ceiling without hiring
7. **NRR Assumptions** (MEDIUM) - 90% NRR unrealistic for point solution

→ **Yes, IF churn ≤4% and ACV ≥$8K. Base case: $500K ARR by Year 3**

### "What can kill this business?"
→ **Churn >5%, ACV <$6K, or competitor feature parity Q1 2027**

### "How much runway do I need?"
→ **$200-300K minimum (18-month runway). Year 1 cash burn ~$100K likely**

### "What's the exit opportunity?"
→ **Acquisition by BambooHR/Rippling if you reach $1M+ ARR before feature parity**
