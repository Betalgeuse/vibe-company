      Market in inflection point 2024-2026 due to tariff volatility + UFLPA enforcement.
      Enterprise players expensive ($100K+ ACV) and slow (6+ month deployment).
      SMB tier severely underserved - KYG Trade entering with AI-native approach signals opportunity.
      Unit economics excellent: $2-5K CAC, 2-4 week sales cycle, 4-6 month payback.
      High churn (50-70%) offset by recurring policy changes (structural, not discretionary).
      ROI-driven positioning (tariff savings, duty optimization) resonates with SMB buyers.

      Defense procurement is niche SMB segment with unique compliance needs poorly served by general tools.

      Unit economics excellent: $3-8K CAC, 6-12 week sales cycle, 6-9 month payback, 4-6:1 LTV:CAC.
      Churn low (2-3% monthly, 20-35% annual) due to high switching costs.
      Strong tailwinds: CMMC 2.0 mandate, DFARS compliance, defense spending rising.
      SMB tier opportunity-rich and less saturated than Enterprise.

    reasoning: |
      Market is mature and consolidating upmarket (ServiceNow, OneTrust, Aravo).
      SMB tier historically underserved but emerging alternatives (MRPeasy, Order.co) address needs.
      Differentiation requires vertical specialization (manufacturing, ecommerce) + SMB stack integration.
      High CAC ($4-8K) relative to ACV ($5-20K) limits profitability.
      Recommendation: Vertical VMS or compliance layer (export + vendor) bundled vs. pure VMS.
