## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE

### Verdict
✅ **CONDITIONAL PASS (24/30 Score)**
- **Status**: GO - Proceed with conditions
- **Primary Model**: Founder-Led Sales (Month 1-6) → SDR-Led (Month 7-12)
- **Year 1 Target**: 25-35 customers | $150-300K ARR

### Reality Checks (Devil's Advocate Findings)
| Item | Claim | Reality |
|------|-------|---------|
| **ACV** | $8K-18K target | 🔴 Realistic $6K-12K (median $9K) |
| **CAC** | <$500 achievable | 🔴 Realistic $1K-1.5K |
| **Sales Cycle** | 45-90 days | ✅ 60-80 days realistic |
| **PLG Viability** | Can be primary GTM | 🔴 NO - only 5-10% trial-to-paid |
| **Founder-Led Sales** | Viable 6 months | ✅ YES - but SDR hire required Month 7 |

### GTM Model Scores
| Model | Score | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Founder-Led Sales** | 7.2/10 | 🏆 PRIMARY (Month 1-6) |
| PLG + Light Sales | 5.7/10 | SECONDARY (Month 3+) |
| Self-Serve Plus | 4.5/10 | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| Channel Partner | 4.8/10 | SECONDARY (Month 7+) |

### Critical Success Factors
1. ✅ **Founder commitment to sales** (5-10 demos/week, not pure product building)
2. ✅ **Realistic ACV** ($6K-12K, not $18K aspirational)
3. ✅ **Product delivers on demo** (IT provisioning smooth, AI functional)
4. ✅ **SDR hire Month 6** (non-negotiable transition plan)
5. ✅ **Realistic expectations** (25-35 customers Year 1, not moonshot targets)

### Biggest Execution Risks
1. 🔴 **Founder burnout (Month 4-6)**: 25-30 hrs/week unsustainable
   - Mitigation: VA hire Month 3, SDR hire Month 6
2. 🔴 **ACV compression**: Market pressure forces discounting
   - Mitigation: Pricing discipline, upsell modules, segment up-market
3. 🔴 **Competitor response**: BambooHR adds IT provisioning (12-18 months)
   - Mitigation: Move fast, build AI moat, customer lock-in

- ❌ 6-12 month ramp (too slow for Year 1)
- ❌ Competitive conflict (BambooHR, Gusto have onboarding)
- ❌ Revenue share 15-30% eats margins
- **Better as**: Year 2+ expansion channel
