## 1. B2B ICP Definition

### Primary Target Segment
| 항목 | 정의 |
|------|------|
| **Industry** | Software/SaaS, Hardware/Electronics, Tech Services (sellers of products internationally) |
| **Company Size** | 10-200 employees (sweet spot: 30-100 emp) |
| **Revenue Range** | $2M-50M ARR |
| **Geography** | US, UK, EU, Canada (English-speaking first year; expand to APAC Y2) |
| **Tech Stack** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Zapier integrations; not tech-heavy ops |
| **Selling Motion** | Direct B2B international sales, not consumer products |

### Secondary Target Segments (Post-MVP)
- **Tier 2**: Manufacturers of electronics/components selling internationally
- **Tier 3**: Logistics/supply chain companies needing compliance visibility

### Buying Committee & Economic Model

| Role | Title | Pain Point | Success Metric | Buying Power |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | VP Operations / Chief Compliance Officer | Can't afford $50K/year on compliance tools; BIS violations = C-suite liability | Reduce compliance cost by 60%, achieve audit-ready status | High (controls budget) |
| **Champion** | Compliance Manager / Legal Operations Lead | 10+ hours/week manual screening, outdated list data, audit risk | Save 8 hours/week, stay current with list updates, pass audits | Medium (day-to-day user) |
| **End Users** | Sales Reps, Customer Success | Delays on contract close due to compliance checks, unclear process | Speed up approvals by 80%, clarity on HS codes | Low (uses tool indirectly) |
| **Blockers** | IT/Data Security | Data residency, API access, integrations with CRM/ERP | SOC2 commitment, RBAC, audit logging | Medium (gate-keeper) |

### Trigger Events (When They Buy)
1. **Compliance Audit Coming**: Customer due diligence check from large enterprise buyer → urgent need to prove compliance
2. **Hiring Compliance Manager**: New CC role → mandate to modernize from spreadsheets
3. **International Expansion Acceleration**: New market entry in regulated regions (EU, APAC) → need enforcement automation
4. **UFLPA Violation Risk**: Recent CBP detention of competitor's goods → wake-up call for supply chain screening
5. **Auditor Recommendation**: External auditor flags manual screening as material risk control gap

## 2. Value Proposition

### ROI Statement
> "With Export Compliance Lite, SMB tech companies save $45K-80K annually by automating 10+ hours/week of manual restricted party screening and avoiding a single $500K+ BIS violation penalty."

### Quantified Value for Target ICP

| Metric | Before (Manual) | After (Automated) | Annual Impact |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Compliance Manager Time** | 10-15 hrs/week | 2-3 hrs/week | Save $40K-60K/year (8-12 hrs × $150/hr) |
| **False Positives** | 15-20% of screens | 2-3% (AI-improved) | Save 3-4 hrs/week investigating false hits |
| **List Update Delays** | 2-4 weeks lag on updates | Real-time daily feeds | Reduce violation risk 80% |
| **Audit Readiness** | Manual logs (audit nightmare) | Centralized audit trail | $5K-10K consulting cost avoided |
| **BIS Violation Risk** | $500K+ per violation (1-2% annual probability) | <0.2% probability (defensible screening) | Risk reduction: $10K-100K expected value |
| **Total 1st Year Value** | — | — | **$55K-170K** |

### Competitive Differentiation

| vs Competitor | Their Weakness | Our Strength |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Visual Compliance ($50K+/year)** | Too expensive for SMBs, slow onboarding (3-6 months) | Freemium entry, 5-minute setup, AI-assisted HS codes |
| **Descartes ($30K-40K/year)** | Enterprise-focused, complex integration | SMB-native pricing tiers, Zapier/integrations, fast time-to-value |
| **KYG Trade** | HS code focused, not DPS emphasis | Integrated: DPS + HS codes + UFLPA in one tool |
| **Excel/Spreadsheets** | Manual, no audit trail, compliance risk | Automated screening, compliance-ready audit logs |

### Why Freemium Model Works Here
- **Lead Gen**: Free tier removes friction for 50+ prospects/month
- **Expansion**: Free users who screen 10+ customers/month convert to paid at 8-12% rate
- **Virality**: Compliance managers share tool with Legal/Sales teams internally (team expansion)

## 4. Pricing Model

### Pricing Strategy: Value-Based Freemium + Usage-Based Expansion

#### Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | Customers/Month | Screens/Month | Target | ACV | Includes |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Up to 25 | Up to 50 | Exploration, SMBs <$5M revenue | $0 | Restricted party screening (CSL, OFAC), HS code suggestions (limit 10/month), basic audit log, email support |
| **Starter** | $199/month | 26-100 | Unlimited | Small tech teams, <$10M revenue | $2.4K/yr | All Free + Bulk CSV upload, UFLPA screening, Zapier integration, priority email support |
| **Pro** | $499/month | 100-500+ | Unlimited | Growth-stage, $10M-50M revenue | $6K/yr | All Starter + Dynamic rescreening (monthly), API access, 10 custom compliance rules, Slack alerts, phone support |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 500+ | Unlimited | Large SMBs, potential acquirers | $12K-25K/yr | All Pro + SSO/SAML, dedicated Slack channel, custom integrations, SLA, quarterly business reviews, SOC2 attestation |

### Pricing Rationale

#### 1. Freemium Entry
- **Why**: Compliance is not a top-10 priority for small tech founders. Freemium removes friction.
- **Conversion Path**: Free users who screen 10+ times/month (20% of users) convert at 12-15% rate to Starter.
- **Lead Gen Economics**: 
  - Free signup CAC: $50-100 (organic + paid search)
  - Freemium-to-Starter conversion rate: 12-15%
  - Effective CAC after conversion: $400-800
  - LTV of $2.4K × 18mo = $36K gross
  - LTV:CAC = 45:1 ← unsustainable; sets expectations wrong

**Better math**: 
- 100 free users signup/month
- 12 convert to Starter ($200/mo × 12mo = $2,400 LTV)
- 100 × 12% × $2,400 = $28,800/mo revenue from cohort
- Revenue per acquisition: $288 (across all 100 users)

#### 2. Starter at $199/Month ($2,400/year)
- **Rationale**: Saves compliance manager 8 hrs/week = $40K/yr value. At 5% of value, $2.4K is a no-brainer.
- **Positioning**: "Save 8 hours/week = $40K/year in labor + $500K+ violation risk mitigation"
- **vs Competitors**: Visual Compliance starts at $50K/year; this is 4.8x cheaper

#### 3. Pro at $499/Month ($6K/year)
- **Rationale**: Adds API access (self-serve integrations) + dynamic rescreening (critical for audit defense). Targets $10M-50M companies.
- **Expansion Driver**: 40% of Starter customers upgrade after 6 months when they add new products/markets that need HS code classification.

#### 4. Enterprise Custom Pricing
- **Why Custom**: Large SMBs need custom integrations, SLA, dedicated support. Each deal is unique.
- **Floor**: $12K/year (2x Pro); ceiling $25K/year (break-even with Visual Compliance for large SMBs)
- **GTM Strategy**: Land at Starter, expand to Pro within 6 months, Enterprise pitch at month 12+.

| **TOTAL** | 100% | **$5.5K blended** | **50** | **$237,000** |

### Acquisition Cost Breakdown

#### Customer Acquisition Strategy (Founder-Led Sales + Content)

| Channel | Leads/Month | Conversion | CAC | Notes |
|---------|------------|-----------|-----|-------|
| **Content Marketing (Blog, SEO)** | 80 | 8% (6.4 SQL) | $200 | "How to avoid BIS violations" blog posts. Organic, compounding. |
| **LinkedIn Outbound** | 40 | 15% (6 SQL) | $300 | Founder + 1 sales dev. Target compliance managers. |
| **Paid Search (Google Ads)** | 60 | 12% (7.2 SQL) | $400 | Keywords: "export compliance," "BIS screening," "HS code classification" |

| **Total Inbound** | **230** | **~33 SQL** | **$250 avg** | — |

#### Sales Motion & CAC Calculation

| Stage | Metric | Cost |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Lead Gen** | 230 leads/month × $250 CAC | $57,500 |

- **LTV (3-year horizon with 6% annual churn)**: $5.5K × 2.7 years = $14,850
- **LTV:CAC**: 11.9:1 ✅ Healthy (>3:1 target)

### Retention & Expansion Revenue

#### Churn Analysis (Year 1 Baseline)
- **Gross Churn**: 8%/year (in line with B2B SaaS SMB benchmarks for $2K-6K price points)
  - Free tier: 15% churn (non-customers, no switching costs)
  - Starter/Pro: 6-7% churn (locked into workflows, audit-critical)
  - Enterprise: 3% churn (high switching costs)
- **Reason**: Misfit (wrong industry), acquisition in manual tool, competitor switch

#### Expansion Revenue Path
| Mechanism | Rate | Impact | Year 1 Revenue |
|-----------|------|--------|---|
| **Starter → Pro Upgrade** | 40% of Starter cohort by mo 6 | Avg +$200/mo per customer | $18K from 50-customer cohort |

## 6. GTM Strategy

### GTM Model: Hybrid PLG + Founder-Led Sales

**Why Hybrid?** 
- Pure PLG fails for compliance (buying committee is Compliance Manager + Legal, not self-service)
- Pure sales-led is too expensive at $2.4K ACV (CAC would be >50% of ACV)
- Hybrid: Free tier attracts explorers → Founder-led sales closes deals

### Phase 1: Founder-Led Sales (Months 1-6)
**Goal**: First 10 customers (validation), build case studies, validate ICP

#### Acquisition Channel Strategy

| Channel | Tactic | Expected Leads/Month | SQL Conversion | Target Monthly Revenue |
|---------|--------|---|---|---|
| **Content Marketing** | 1 blog post/week on "How to Avoid BIS Violations," "HS Code Classification," "UFLPA Compliance" | 80 | 8% (6 SQL) | $15K (6 × $2.5K blended ACV) |
| **LinkedIn Outbound** | Founder + 1 sales coordinator: 50 outreach/week to Compliance Managers at tech companies | 40 | 15% (6 SQL) | $15K |
| **Paid Search** | Google Ads on keywords: "export compliance software," "BIS screening," "restricted party list" | 60 | 12% (7 SQL) | $17.5K |
| **Referral Program** | Tax accountants, export lawyers refer to SMB clients (15% commission on Year 1 ACV) | 20 | 30% (6 SQL) | $15K |
| **Product Hunt Launch** | Month 2: Launch on PH for visibility + early adopter credibility | 100 (launch week) | 3% (3 SQL) | $7.5K |
| **Community** | Active in Compliance/Export communities (LinkedIn groups, Slack), answer questions daily | 30 | 5% (1.5 SQL) | $3.75K |
| **Total** | — | **~230 leads** | **~33 SQL** | **~$73.75K/month** |

**Reality Check (Conservative)**: 
- First 3 months: 5 customers/month × $3K blended ACV = $15K MRR
- Months 4-6: 8 customers/month × $3.5K ACV = $28K MRR
- By month 6, running rate = $28K MRR = $336K ARR (with 8% churn factored)

### Sales Playbook: Founder-Led (Months 1-6)

#### Prospecting Strategy
| Activity | Target | Frequency | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn Search** | Compliance Manager, Legal Ops, VP Operations at $2M-50M revenue tech companies | 2x/week | 80% of ICP reachable here |
| **Trigger Event Outreach** | Companies that just hired Compliance Manager (LinkedIn alerts) | 1x/day | 60% close rate on trigger events |
| **Email Outreach** | Founders/CTOs at tech companies with <$5M revenue (lower-hanging fruit for ACV) | 3x/week | Test market fit |
| **Community Engagement** | Answer export compliance questions in LinkedIn groups, Slack communities | Daily | Build authority, generate inbound |
| **Warm Intros** | Ask first 5 customers for 3-5 warm intros each | Ongoing | 30%+ close rate on warm intros |

#### Discovery Call Framework (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Qualify if they fit ICP + understand buying trigger

```
1. Current State (5 min)
   "How are you currently managing restricted party screening?"
   [Listen for: manual process, Excel, no process]

2. Pain Quantification (5 min)
   "How many hours/week does this take?"
   "Have you had any BIS violations or close calls?"
   [Listen for: 10+ hrs/week, recent regulatory issue]

3. Buying Trigger (5 min)
   "What's driving this conversation now?"
   [Listen for: audit coming, new hire, expansion plan, recent competitor incident]

4. Buying Committee (5 min)
   "Who else would need to sign off on this?"
   [Listen for: CFO, General Counsel, avoid >3-person committees]

5. Timeline (5 min)
   "When would you want to have this solved by?"
   [Expect: 30-60 days. If >90 days, not urgent.]

6. Next Steps (0 min, automate)
   "I'm going to send you a 5-minute walkthrough video of how we screen customers. Reply with 2-3 of your customers and I'll run them through our system so you can see it in action."
```

#### Demo Script Outline (15 minutes)
**Note**: Show product, not slides. Share screen with their customer list loaded.

1. **Problem Recap** (1 min)
   - "You're spending 10+ hours/week screening customers manually against 6+ government lists. Let me show you how we do it in 10 seconds."

2. **Setup & Speed** (2 min)
   - Live demo: CSV upload → "Click screen" → Show results in real-time
   - "Takes 10 seconds vs 1-2 hours manually. Every list auto-updates daily."

3. **Audit Trail** (2 min)
   - Show audit dashboard: "Every screening timestamped, logged, audit-ready. No more spreadsheets."
   - "External auditors ask for this. You'll pass without extra work."

4. **HS Code Intelligence** (3 min)
   - "Type product description: 'Smart WiFi thermostat controlled by software'"
   - AI suggests HS code, shows tariff impact, explains reasoning
   - "This saves 30 minutes per product classification. Catches misclassifications that cost $10K+ in duties."

5. **UFLPA Checking** (2 min)
   - "Flag any suppliers from Xinjiang XUAR. 17,000 shipments detained last year, $3.7B. Here's how we prevent that."

6. **Pricing & ROI** (3 min)
   - "Your time: $150/hr × 10 hrs/week × 52 weeks = $78K/year savings"
   - "Violation risk reduction: $500K exposure → 0.2% probability = $1K/year expected value"
   - "Our tool: $199-499/month. ROI: 15-30x on day 1."

7. **Objection Handling** (2 min)
   - *"We use Visual Compliance"* → "Great. We're 4.8x cheaper, and we include HS codes."
   - *"Do we really need this?"* → "What's your plan if an auditor asks for a timestamped log of every screen? That's $10K+ in consulting to recreate."
   - *"We need IT approval"* → "Share this one-pager. We're SOC2-ready, RBAC, API-first. IT loves us because we integrate (Zapier, Salesforce)."
   - *"Too expensive"* → "Try Free tier. Load 25 customers, see the 10-hour savings. Then $199/month is 1-2 hours of the manager's time."

#### Sales Closing Mechanics

| Stage | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Discovery** | 30-min call, send followup with 2 customer screens | Day 1-2 |
| **Evaluation** | Customer tries Free tier, loads 5-10 customers | Days 3-5 |
| **Decision** | Founder check-in: "What would help you move forward?" | Day 6-7 |
| **Close** | Annual contract offer: $2,040 (Starter) or $5,100 (Pro) with 15% annual discount | Day 8-10 |
| **Setup** | Compliance Manager onboarded (Loom video + 15-min setup call) | Day 11-14 |

**Bottleneck Avoidance**: If customer says "let me check with IT," send 1-pager before they forget. If "let me talk to CFO," you're not qualified (too high-touch). Redirect to land-and-expand model: close Compliance Manager first at Starter, upsell to CFO in mo 3.

## 7. Onboarding Flow & Activation Metrics

### Goal: Time-to-First-Value <1 Hour

Export compliance is high-stakes, so activation is not "I played with the product," but "I screened my first customer and got a result."

### Onboarding Flow (Step-by-Step)

#### Stage 1: Signup (2 minutes)
```
Visitor lands on homepage
  ↓
"Start Free" button
  ↓
Email signup form
  ↓
Confirm email (instant link)
  ↓
Land in product
```

**Design Notes**:
- Homepage: "Automate export compliance screening. Free for your first 25 customers."
- One-field signup (email only). No "company size" dropdown.
- Instant email confirmation link (no 5-minute wait).
- Mobile-optimized signup.

#### Stage 2: Onboarding Wizard (5 minutes)
Upon login, user sees onboarding wizard (no skipping):

```
Step 1: "What's your role?" 
   Options: Compliance Manager | Legal | Operations | Other
   → Customize experience based on role

Step 2: "How many customers do you currently screen?"
   Slider: 0-25 | 25-100 | 100-500 | 500+
   → Set expectations (Free tier = 25 screening limit)

Step 3: "Have you heard of BIS EAR?"
   Yes | No | Unsure
   → If No/Unsure, show 2-minute explainer video

Step 4: "Upload your first batch"
   Sample CSV provided
   OR
   Paste in a customer name + company
   → Load sample data automatically
   
Step 5: "Let's screen them"
   One-click "Screen Now" button
   → Real-time results appear
```

**Design Notes**:
- Progress bar shows "Step 1 of 5" (creates momentum)
- Each step has a "Skip" button but copy says "Most customers complete this in 5 min"
- Step 4 offers sample data so user doesn't have to find their own
- Step 5 is the "aha moment" → immediate screening result

#### Stage 3: First Screening Result (2 minutes)
```
Results page shows:
- ✅ "3 customers screened successfully"
- ⚠️ "1 customer flagged: John Smith (potential BIS Entity List match)"
- 📊 "All results timestamped and audit-logged"
- 💾 "Export audit report (PDF)"

Below results:
- "What would help next?" suggestions:
  - [ ] Upload your full customer list
  - [ ] Explore HS code classification
  - [ ] Review UFLPA guidelines
  - [ ] Integrate with Salesforce (upgrade to Pro)
```

**Design Notes**:
- Show flagged results first (creates urgency, shows value)
- Every action creates audit log (show this to compliance managers)
- Suggest next steps (help users self-serve or upgrade)

#### Stage 4: Free Tier Limits (Transparent Messaging)
After 25 screens or 7 days of free access:

```
"You're approaching your free tier limit (24/25 screens used)"

Options:
1. "Upgrade to Starter" ($199/mo)
   - Unlimited screenings
   - Bulk CSV upload
   - UFLPA screening
   - Save 8 hrs/week

2. "See Pro features" ($499/mo)
   - All Starter
   - API access
   - Real-time Zapier integration
   - Dynamic rescreening

3. "Talk to sales" (book 15-min call)
   - "Not sure which tier?"
   - "Need a custom plan?"
```

**Design Notes**:
- Don't hard-stop users; soft limit with suggestion
- Show value before paywall (they've now seen results)
- Offer sales call (some users need reassurance before paying)

### Activation Metrics Definition

#### Primary Activation Metric: **"First Successful Screen"**
- **Definition**: User completes ≥1 restricted party screening and receives results within first 24 hours of signup.
- **Target**: 60% of Free signups activate within 24 hours.
- **Why**: This is the "aha moment." User realizes "This thing actually works and saves me 1 hour."
- **Tracking**: Segment Free users by activation status; measure email engagement from activated users.

#### Secondary Metrics (Engagement)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---|
| **Onboarding Completion Rate** | ≥70% of signups complete 5-step wizard | Indicates intent; dropouts = UX issues |
| **Time-to-First-Screen** | <5 minutes from signup to first screening | Speed = engagement. If >30 min, user is friction-fatigued. |
| **Number of Screens (Free Tier)** | ≥10 screens per user in first 7 days | Usage velocity predicts conversion |
| **CSV Upload Adoption** | ≥30% of Free users upload CSV (vs single screens) | Indicates business intent (batch processing = serious user) |
| **Return Visits (1-day cohort)** | ≥40% return within 24 hours | Engagement signal. If low, onboarding is too hard. |
| **Feature Exploration** | ≥20% explore HS code tool in first 7 days | Multi-feature usage = deeper value realization |

#### Conversion Metrics (Free → Paid)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---|
| **Free-to-Paid Conversion** | 12-15% of activated users convert within 30 days | Primary revenue driver |
| **Conversion Rate (10+ screens)** | 25%+ of users who screen ≥10 customers convert | High-intent segment |
| **Conversion Rate (CSV upload)** | 30%+ of users who bulk upload convert | Business users (not explorers) |
| **Average Time-to-Convert** | 8-12 days from signup to paid | Indicator of consideration cycle |
| **CAC Payback Period** | ≤3 months from paid signup | Unit economics health |

#### Retention Metrics (Paid Users)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|---|
| **1-Month Retention** | ≥85% of Starter customers active after 30 days | Early churn indicator |
| **3-Month Retention** | ≥75% of Starter customers active after 90 days | Product-market fit signal |
| **6-Month Retention** | ≥70% of Starter customers active after 180 days | Long-term viability |
| **Screens/Month** | ≥50 screens/month per Starter customer | Usage velocity; churn predictor |
| **Upgrade to Pro** | 30-40% of Starter customers upgrade to Pro by month 6 | Expansion revenue |

### Onboarding Dashboard (For Tracking)

Track via Mixpanel / Amplitude events:

```
Free Signup Cohort (May 1)
├─ Total Signups: 150
├─ Completed Wizard: 105 (70%)
├─ First Screen (24h): 63 (42% of cohort, 60% of activated)
├─ 10+ Screens (7d): 38 (25%)
├─ CSV Upload: 22 (15%)
├─ Return Visit (Day 2): 68 (45%)
├─ Paid Conversion (30d):
│  ├─ Starter: 12 customers × $2,400/yr = $28,800
│  ├─ Pro: 4 customers × $6,000/yr = $24,000
│  └─ Total: 16 conversions (10.7% rate, target 12% ✅)
```

---

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Long Sales Cycle** | Medium (45-60 days typical for compliance) | High (cash flow squeeze) | Offer annual contract at discount (15% off). Freemium creates 12-month engagement before close. |
| **Competing with Incumbents (Visual Compliance)** | Medium | Medium | Freemium + SMB-first pricing undercuts incumbents. Faster onboarding. Position as "distributed" (API-first) vs "enterprise-only." |
| **CSL List Data Errors** | Low (government maintains) | High (false positives destroy trust) | Implement fuzzy matching to reduce false positives. Show confidence scores. Always allow manual override. Monitor for CSL updates. |
| **Regulatory Changes (New sanctions, BIS rules)** | Medium | Medium | Monitor BIS updates daily. Communicate changes to customers via email/in-app. Build "future-proof" architecture (easy to add new lists). |
| **Product-Market Fit Misses** | Medium | High (wasted 3 months) | Validate ICP with 20 discovery calls before launch. Test messaging variants. Pivot quickly if response is poor. |
| **Technical Debt (Poor Architecture)** | Medium (MVP-quality code) | Medium | Design for multi-tenancy from Day 1 (even if not needed). Use established frameworks (not custom). Plan refactor in Q2. |
| **Churn Due to Integrations** | Medium (customers want API integration) | Medium | Roadmap API in Q2 (P1 priority). Offer CSV as bridge solution. |
| **Team Fatigue (Solo founder or small team)** | Medium | High | Hire SDR by Month 4 to reduce founder sales load. Use no-code tools (Zapier, Make) to avoid over-engineering. |
| **Paid Search CAC Too High** | Low (calculated at $300-400) | Medium | Start with organic (blog, content). Test paid only after organic works. Set CAC cap at $800. |

---

## 10. Founder-Market Fit

### Required Skills/Experience

| Area | Required for Success | Founder Has | Gap Analysis | How to Fill |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain Expertise** | Export compliance, BIS/EAR regulations, HS codes, trade law | Assume founder has some (research/reading) | May need deeper understanding | • Take online export compliance course (LinkedIn Learning, AAEI) • Network with compliance professionals • Do 20 discovery calls before building |
| **Sales Ability** | Ability to close $2-6K/year deals, understand buying committees, handle objections | Assume founder can learn | No prior B2B sales is risky | • Close first 5 deals yourself (required) • Read "The Guide to B2B Sales" • Practice discovery calls with advisors |
| **Technical** | Can build MVP: web app, database, API, multi-tenancy | Full stack engineer assumed | If not technical, partner or hire | • Hire contractor for 3-month MVP build • Partner with technical co-founder • Consider no-code MVP first (Airtable → Zapier) |
| **Network** | Access to compliance managers, export professionals, early adopters | Limited network assumed | Huge advantage if you have this | • LinkedIn outreach (cold opens) • Join compliance groups (NCMS, IADC) • Recruit advisory board (3-5 compliance pros) |
| **Capital** | $30K-50K for MVP development and initial go-to-market | Self-funded assumed | If bootstrapped, takes longer | • Raise $50-100K pre-seed (use projections from this doc) • Bootstrap but hire product dev contractor • Apply to startup accelerators |
