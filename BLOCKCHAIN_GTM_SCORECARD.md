| **Model A (PLG)** | 9/10 | Fast time-to-value (5 min demo), viral potential, developer-native adoption |
| **Model B (Founder-Led)** | 8/10 | Perfect ACV ($18-35K), 2-3 week cycle, repeatable sales process |
| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 8.5/10 | Developer preference for self-serve, freemium model proven by Dune/Linear |
| **Bonus Factors** | +2.5 | Founder can execute solo, freemium potential, community-driven GTM |
| **TOTAL** | **28/40** | **HIGHEST** |
| **Founder Viability** | ✅ YES | Can reach $300K ARR Year 1 without hiring salespeople |
| **Capital Required** | $20-30K | Lowest among all 5 |
| **Time to Revenue** | 8 weeks | MVP → first customers |
| **Risk Level** | MEDIUM | Free Foundry alternative exists; product complexity |

---

### 2️⃣ ON-CHAIN ANALYTICS - VERTICAL FOCUS - **26/40** ✅

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Model A (PLG)** | 8/10 | Data tools drive trial-to-paid conversion, viral within communities, freemium works |
| **Model B (Founder-Led)** | 7/10 | Works but requires data literacy; hits scaling ceiling at 40-50 customers |
| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 8/10 | Analysts prefer exploratory self-serve, low CS burden, expansion pricing works |
| **Bonus Factors** | +3 | Freemium + community potential, vertical specialization = differentiation |
| **TOTAL** | **26/40** | **STRONG** |
| **Founder Viability** | ✅ YES | Can reach $250K ARR Year 1 with freemium-first model |
| **Capital Required** | $50-100K | Data infrastructure (Alchemy, Infura subscriptions) |
| **Time to Revenue** | 10-12 weeks | MVP → Product Hunt launch → first customers |
| **Risk Level** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Data costs scale; Dune is free alternative; market saturation risk |

---

### 3️⃣ PROTOCOL INFRASTRUCTURE/L2/ZK - **24/40** ✅

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Model A (PLG)** | 7/10 | Free tier works, self-serve developer adoption, usage-based pricing appeals |
| **Model B (Founder-Led)** | 8/10 | Enterprise upmarket possible ($50K+), repeatable demos, expansion clear |
| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 7.5/10 | Developer preference, but requires 24/7 support burden |
| **Bonus Factors** | +1.5 | Infrastructure costs scale with revenue (positive unit economics at scale) |
| **TOTAL** | **24/40** | **VIABLE** |
| **Founder Viability** | ✅ YES (tight) | Can reach $400K ARR Year 1 but tight on ops |
| **Capital Required** | $100K+ | Node infrastructure, monitoring systems |
| **Time to Revenue** | 8-10 weeks | MVP → free tier launch → first customers |
| **Risk Level** | MEDIUM-HIGH | High ops burden (24/7 uptime); Alchemy/Infura could match pricing |

---

### 4️⃣ COMPLIANCE & KYC FOR SMB - **22/40** ⚠️

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Model A (PLG)** | 5/10 | Compliance buyers don't self-serve; trust/liability concerns; no PLG proof |
| **Model B (Founder-Led)** | 8.5/10 | Perfect for this buyer type; 3-4 week cycle; repeatable process |
| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 4/10 | Compliance officers won't use self-serve for risk decisions |
| **Bonus Factors** | +4.5 | Regulatory tailwind (MiCA, AMLR), competitive gap, high LTV:CAC |
| **TOTAL** | **22/40** | **MINIMUM VIABLE** |
| **Founder Viability** | ✅ CONDITIONAL | Can reach $280K ARR if founder learns compliance domain |
| **Capital Required** | $10-20K | Minimal (no data subscriptions needed) |
| **Time to Revenue** | 12 weeks | MVP → initial customers |
| **Risk Level** | MEDIUM | Regulatory uncertainty; incumbent downmarket risk; compliance learning curve |

---

### 5️⃣ WALLET/CUSTODY SOLUTIONS - **18/40** ⚠️

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Model A (PLG)** | 4/10 | Custody is high-trust; no one self-serves wallet decisions; liability concerns |
| **Model B (Founder-Led)** | 7.5/10 | Works but longer sales cycle (4-8 weeks); regulatory complexity |
| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 2/10 | Custody = opposite of self-serve; buyer will demand expert consultation |
| **Bonus Factors** | -0.5 | High capital requirement, regulatory burden, incumbent strength (Fireblocks $8B) |
| **TOTAL** | **18/40** | **HIGH RISK** |
| **Founder Viability** | ❌ NO | Requires ops team + compliance expertise; not solo-founder playbook |
| **Capital Required** | $200K+ | Security audit ($50-100K), insurance, infrastructure, ops staff |
| **Time to Revenue** | 16+ weeks | MVP → security audit → first customers |
| **Risk Level** | CRITICAL | Regulatory (MSB license), incumbent dominance (Fireblocks), liability |

## FINAL VERDICT & RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: **#1 Smart Contract Testing SaaS**

✅ **Why:**
- Highest GTM fit score (28/40)
- Lowest capital requirement ($20-30K)
- Fastest revenue (8 weeks to first customers)
- Clearest founder-led path (4-5 demos/week)
- Strongest viral/community potential (GitHub + Product Hunt)
- Can reach $300K ARR solo in 12-18 months
- Lowest regulatory risk
- Strongest product-market fit signals (Foundry adoption proves market pain)

📋 **Action Plan:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Customer research (20 calls with lead developers)
2. **Week 3-8:** MVP build (Hardhat UX + Foundry speed)
3. **Week 9-10:** Launch freemium tier + Product Hunt
4. **Month 3-6:** Founder-led sales (4-5 demos/week, 20-30 customers)
5. **Month 6+:** Scale freemium, measure viral adoption

---

### SECONDARY RECOMMENDATION: **#2 On-Chain Analytics - Vertical Focus**

✅ **Why:**
- Second highest GTM fit (26/40)
- Strong freemium/PLG model (community-driven growth)
- Vertical specialization = differentiation vs Dune/Nansen
- Can reach $250K ARR with right vertical choice
- Requires capital but has proven model (Dune, Nansen both succeed)

⚠️ **Condition:** Have $50-100K for data infrastructure

📋 **Action Plan:**
1. **Month 1:** Validate vertical (options, yield farming, or NFT markets?)
2. **Month 2-3:** Customer research (20 calls with analysts/traders in vertical)
3. **Month 3-6:** MVP build + free tier launch
4. **Month 6+:** Product Hunt launch, freemium adoption

---

### TERTIARY RECOMMENDATION: **#3 Protocol Infrastructure/L2/ZK**

⚠️ **Why (Conditional):**
- Third highest GTM fit (24/40)
- Largest ARR potential ($250-400K)
- Free tier drives adoption (network effects for reliability)
- Expansion revenue scales with customer growth

❌ **Condition:** Requires ops expertise + $100K+ capital

📋 **Action Plan:**
- Only pursue if you have DevOps/SRE background
- Requires 24/7 operational readiness
- High infrastructure costs = break-even analysis critical

---

### CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION: **#4 Compliance & KYC for SMB**

⚠️ **Why (Conditional):**
- Regulatory tailwind (MiCA, AMLR = positive market timing)
- Founder-led sales model proven by Chainalysis
- Clear competitive positioning (1/5 cost of Chainalysis)
- Can reach $280K ARR

❌ **Condition:** Founder willing to learn AML/AMLR/MiCA domain

📋 **Action Plan:**
- Only pursue if you commit to compliance learning (4-6 week ramp)
- Requires LinkedIn prospecting + cold email (4-6 demos/week)
- Moderate capital ($10-20K)

---

### STRONG REJECTION: **#5 Wallet/Custody Solutions**

❌ **Why REJECT:**
- Lowest GTM fit (18/40)
- Highest capital requirement ($200K+)
- Longest sales cycle (4-8 weeks)
- Strongest incumbent moat (Fireblocks $8B)
- Requires custody expertise (security + compliance)
- Regulatory complexity (MSB licensing)

- Not solo-founder viable

**Recommendation:** Skip entirely unless you have 10+ years custody/security experience.

---

## EXECUTION PRIORITY

### Month 1-2: VALIDATION
- [ ] #1 Testing: 20 customer interviews → validate problem + WTP
- [ ] #2 Analytics: 15 customer interviews → validate vertical + WTP
- [ ] #4 Compliance: 10 customer interviews → validate GTM + regulatory tailwind

### Month 2: GO/NO-GO DECISION
- **#1:** Go if 70%+ say "Yes, I'd pay $500-1K/mo for this"
- **#2:** Go if 60%+ say "Yes, I'd pay $299/mo for vertical focus"
- **#4:** Go if 80%+ say "Yes, compliance is urgent" + regulatory trend confirmed

### Month 3-6: BUILD & LAUNCH
- **Primary:** Execute MVP for chosen opportunity
- **Secondary (Optional):** Parallel customer discovery for #2 or #3

### Month 6+: SCALE
- Hit $150K+ ARR with primary
- Consider secondary if primary validates strongly
