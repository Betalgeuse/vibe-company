## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE

### Opportunity 1: Export Compliance Lite
```
Score:         27/30 ⭐⭐⭐
Verdict:       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ✅
GTM Model:     Hybrid PLG + Self-Serve (Models A+C)
Founder Work:  LOW (product focus)
Year 1 ARR:    $150-250K
Best For:      Tech founders who want to build product, not sell
Risk Level:    MEDIUM (churn 40-55% but market-proven model)
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- ✅ Freemium model proven by Quickcode + KYG Trade
- ✅ Tech-savvy buyers expect self-serve; no sales friction
- ✅ 2-3 week sales cycle = fast freemium-to-paid conversion
- ❌ Requires excellent product UX (non-negotiable)
- ❌ High churn (40-55%) requires strong expansion revenue

**Go-to-Market Summary:**
1. Launch freemium tier ($0-500/mo) with core HS classification + denied party screening
2. Drive self-serve signups via Product Hunt, G2, LinkedIn, organic SEO
3. Founder does 2-3 demo calls/week for expansion leads ($8-12K tier)
4. Upsell path: freemium → $4K (UFLPA) → $8K (tariff modeling) → $12K (API/integration)

---

### Opportunity 2: Supplier Compliance Risk
```
Score:         24/30 ⭐⭐⭐
Verdict:       RECOMMENDED ✅
GTM Model:     Founder-Led Sales (Model B)
Founder Work:  MEDIUM (4-6 demos/week)
Year 1 ARR:    $200-300K
Best For:      Founders who enjoy consultative selling
Risk Level:    MEDIUM (founder bottleneck, churn 30-40%)
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- ✅ Supply chain managers (target buyers) are NOT self-serve users
- ✅ $5-15K ACV supports founder-led math (20-30 customers/year)
- ✅ 2-4 week sales cycle achievable with demos
- ✅ Entire market is enterprise-focused; SMB tier wide open
- ❌ Founder becomes sales bottleneck (scales to only 20-30 customers/year)
- ❌ Requires founder commitment to 4-6 demos/week for 12 months

**Go-to-Market Summary:**
1. Pre-qualify on LinkedIn: 50+ suppliers, international sourcing, manufacturing
2. Founder does 4-6 custom demo calls/week (20-30 min each)
3. Custom risk assessment shows real impact in demo
4. Close in 2-4 weeks at $5-15K ACV
5. Post-sale: expansion via custom integrations, ESG scoring, quarterly reviews
