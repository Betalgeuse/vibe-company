## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Testing SaaS

### What If: CAC Increases 50%?

```
Base Case: CAC $1,200
Stress Case: CAC $1,800 (+50%)

Impact:
- Payback period: 1.8 mo → 2.7 mo
- LTV:CAC: 23:1 → 15:1 (still excellent)
- Year 1 customers: ~32 → ~28 (lower acquisition)
- Year 1 revenue: ~$127K → ~$110K (-13%)

Verdict: ✅ Still viable, but margins thinner
```

### What If: Churn Increases to 2.5%?

```
Base Case: Monthly churn 1.5%
Stress Case: Monthly churn 2.5% (+67%)

Impact:
- LTV: $28K → $19K
- LTV:CAC: 23:1 → 16:1 (still excellent)
- Year 1 retention: 29 customers → 22 customers
- Year 1 revenue: $127K → $95K (-25%)

Verdict: ⚠️ Still profitable, but growth slows significantly
```

### What If: ACV Drops to $6K?

```
Base Case: ACV $9.6K
Stress Case: ACV $6K (-37%)

Impact:
- Monthly revenue drops 37%
- LTV: $28K → $18.3K
- LTV:CAC: 23:1 → 15:1
- Year 1 revenue: $127K → $80K

Verdict: ❌ Marginal profitability, not recommended
```

### Best Case: All Metrics Optimize

```
Optimistic assumptions:
- CAC drops to $900 (community viral, strong network effects)
- Churn stays at 1% (better product-market fit)
- ACV rises to $12K (more Pro/Enterprise mix)
- Acquisition rate: 4/month (vs 2.5/month base)

Year 1 Results:
- Customers: 45+
- Revenue: $200K+
- Gross Profit: $168K
- Net Income: $150K+
- Payback: <1 month

Verdict: 🚀 Exceptional outcome if execution perfect
