## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX

### Choose #1 (Testing) If You Want:
- ✅ Fastest path to profitability (Month 3)
- ✅ Lowest capital requirement ($15-25K)
- ✅ Best unit economics (86/100 score)
- ✅ Solo founder viable

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### For Testing SaaS (#1)

1. **UX Must Be 10x Better Than Free Tools**
   - Foundry is free; you're asking devs to pay
   - Speed + ease-of-use is your only differentiator
   - Risk: If UX only "2x better," pricing power collapses

2. **Freemium Must Have Clear Paywall**
   - Free tier: 50 test runs/month
   - Paid tier: Unlimited + team features
   - Risk: If ceiling too high, free users never convert

3. **Sales Cycle Must Stay <2 Weeks**
   - Free alternatives have zero switching cost
   - If enterprise sales cycle extends 4+ weeks, CAC explodes
   - Strategy: Keep deals small ($500-1K), emphasize speed

4. **Churn Must Stay <2%**
   - Developer tools typically churn 1-3%
   - If implementation is sloppy, churn could reach 5%+
   - Mitigation: Premium onboarding + community support

5. **Product-Market Fit Must Emerge by Month 4**
   - By Month 4, should have clear PMF signals
   - If no PMF signals → pivot or shutdown
   - Key signal: 3+ inbound leads/week from existing customers
