## 🎯 FRAMEWORK APPLIED

### GTM Model Fit Scoring (0-40 Points)

Each of 5 opportunities evaluated on 4 dimensions:

| Dimension | Max Points | Scoring Criteria |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Model A (PLG)** | 10 | Time-to-value, trial conversion, viral potential, buyer tech-savviness |

| **Model C (Self-Serve)** | 10 | Developer preference, free tier viability, expansion path, CS scalability |
| **Bonus Factors** | 10 | Capital efficiency, founder solo viability, market proof, scaling potential |
| **TOTAL** | **40** | **Pass threshold: 22/40** |

### Results

| Opportunity | A | B | C | Bonus | Total | Verdict |
|-------------|---|---|---|-------|-------|---------|
| #1 Testing | 9 | 8 | 8.5 | +2.5 | 28/40 | ✅ HIGHLY REC |

| #5 Custody | 4 | 7.5 | 2 | -0.5 | 18/40 | ❌ HIGH RISK |

---

## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIMARY: Smart Contract Testing SaaS (28/40)
**Status:** ✅ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**Rationale:**
- Clearest founder-led GTM path
- Lowest capital requirement ($20-30K)
- Fastest revenue path (8 weeks to first customers)
- Strongest solo-founder viability
- Best viral/community adoption potential
- Realistic Year 1 ARR: $200-300K

**GTM Model:** Founder-Led Sales (4-5 demos/week) + PLG freemium (months 6+)

**Next Step:** Schedule 20 customer calls with lead developers this week

---

### SECONDARY: On-Chain Analytics - Vertical Focus (26/40)
**Status:** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**Rationale:**
- Strong PLG/freemium model (community-driven growth)
- Vertical specialization = clear differentiation vs Dune
- Realistic Year 1 ARR: $150-250K
- Lower founder sales burden (2-3 demos/week)
- Community adoption potential

**Requirement:** $50-100K capital for data infrastructure

**Next Step:** Validate vertical choice + secure capital

---

### TERTIARY: Protocol Infrastructure/L2/ZK (24/40)
**Status:** ✅ **RECOMMENDED** (conditional)

**Rationale:**
- Largest ARR potential ($250-400K)
- Free tier drives adoption (network effects)
- Usage-based pricing aligns with customer growth
- Founder-led + freemium hybrid

**Requirement:** $100K+ capital + DevOps/ops expertise

**Next Step:** Assess ops expertise availability

---

### CONDITIONAL: Compliance & KYC for SMB (22/40)
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS**

**Rationale:**
- Regulatory tailwind (MiCA, AMLR = positive)
- Clear GTM path (founder-led sales proven)
- Realistic Year 1 ARR: $180-280K
- Minimum viable GTM score (22/40)

**Requirement:** Founder willing to learn AML/AMLR domain

**Risk:** Regulatory uncertainty, incumbent downmarket threat

**Next Step:** Take compliance course + validate market timing

---

### REJECTION: Wallet/Custody Solutions (18/40)
**Status:** ❌ **STRONG REJECTION**

**Reasons for Rejection:**
- Lowest GTM fit score (18/40)
- Highest capital requirement ($200K+)
- Longest sales cycle (4-8 weeks)
- Strongest incumbent moat (Fireblocks $8B)
- Requires custody/security expertise
- Regulatory complexity (MSB licensing)
- High liability risk

**Recommendation:** SKIP entirely unless founder has 10+ years custody experience + $200K capital
