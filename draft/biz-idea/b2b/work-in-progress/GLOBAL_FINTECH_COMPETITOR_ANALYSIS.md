### White Space Identified: FinTech B2B SaaS

#### Opportunity #1: **Mid-Market (Underserved) Financial Analysis Platform**
- **Gap**: Tools like OpenBB are enterprise-focused; Fintool is too focused on single equity research
- **Target**: Wealth managers, RIAs, multi-family offices ($50M-$500M AUM)
- **Niche Angle**: 
  - Pre-built workflows for portfolio analysis (not just research)
  - Integrated compliance/reporting (GIPS, SOX-lite, CRS)
  - Easier onboarding than OpenBB (no API engineering needed)
  - Pricing: $2K-5K/year (vs. $50K+ enterprise)
- **2-Person Team Fit**: **HIGH**
  - Build initial MVP with web UI + lightweight Python backend

  - Partner with Fiscal.ai or IEX Cloud for data
  - Customer acquisition via LinkedIn + RIA associations

  - Automated warning system (covenant violations, rating downgrades)
  - Deal-level analytics dashboard
