    blockers:
      - title: "State Pharmacy Board / Regulatory Compliance Officer"
        department: "Compliance / Regulatory Affairs"
        objection: "AI cannot independently verify prescriptions or check drug interactions without direct pharmacist oversight. State law requires licensed pharmacist to make final verification decision."
        concern: "Are we compliant with state pharmacy practice laws? What's our liability if AI makes an error?"
        veto_power: "HARD VETO - state boards can block adoption"
        
      - title: "IT / Chief Information Officer"
        department: "Health Information Technology"
        objection: "Integration with legacy pharmacy systems is expensive and risky. HIPAA compliance, audit trails, API stability are concerns."

      - title: "Risk / Legal Officer"
        department: "Legal / Risk Management"
        objection: "Autonomous pharmacy AI lacks clear legal liability framework. If the AI makes an error and a patient is harmed, who's responsible—hospital, vendor, pharmacist, or pharmacy board?"
        concern: "What's our malpractice exposure? Will our insurance carrier cover this?"

      - name: "Epic, Cerner, Elation Health (EHR-Embedded Pharmacy)"
        approach: "Built-in pharmacy modules with interaction alerts; already in 90% of hospitals"
        moat: "Network effects, switching cost, ownership of medical record"
        price: "Bundled into EHR contract"
        
    indirect_alternatives:
      - "Manual pharmacy verification by pharmacists (status quo)"
      - "Outsourcing pharmacy to 3rd-party pharmacy chains"
      - "Hiring more pharmacy staff (doesn't solve shortage)"
      
    why_gap_exists: "Existing solutions (Micromedex, etc.) support pharmacists but don't replace them. Regulatory barrier prevents true replacement. No vendor has attempted to deploy autonomous AI for prescription verification due to legal liability."
    
  gtm_analysis:
    sales_cycle_length: "6-12 months"
    breakdown:
      - "Awareness / initial meeting: 1-2 months"

      - "VAT review & stakeholder approval: 2-4 months"
      - "Contract negotiation & IT integration planning: 1-2 months"
      - "Implementation & rollout: 1-2 months"
    buying_triggers: "Pharmacist resignation, high error rates, staffing shortages, accreditation review"
    decision_velocity: "SLOW (healthcare is conservative)"

    total_addressable_market: "$150M-400M"
    
  scoring_summary:
    market_size_score: 7/10
      reasoning: "TAM $100M-200M is reasonable for B2B SaaS, but market is already served by robotic automation vendors and EHR giants"
    icp_clarity_score: 5/10
      reasoning: "ICP is identifiable (pharmacy directors, hospitals), but role fragmentation (some hospitals outsource to pharmacy chains) and budget variance across hospital sizes makes targeting unclear"
    regulatory_score: 2/10
      reasoning: "State pharmacy boards do not allow autonomous AI to verify prescriptions. Would require state-by-state regulatory change (estimated 5-10 year timeline)"
    gtm_score: 4/10
      reasoning: "Long sales cycle (6-12 mo), high integration cost, strong incumbent competition, founder needs pharmacy domain expertise"
    founder_fit_score: 3/10
      reasoning: "Unless founder has pharmacy background or deep healthcare experience, credibility gap will be hard to overcome. Competitors have ex-pharmacist CTOs."
      
  verdict: "CONDITIONAL REJECT"
    rationale: "Real pain point and defensible TAM, but regulatory barriers prevent market adoption in next 2-3 years. Even if you build the technology, you cannot legally deploy it autonomously in any state. Alternative path: Build as decision-support tool (like Micromedex), not replacement. But that's a smaller market and crowded with incumbents."
    
  recommendation: "Do not pursue unless you can (a) secure state pharmacy board pre-approval for pilot, or (b) reframe as pharmacist decision-support (not replacement). In latter case, market is still crowded but unblocked."

    champion:
      title: "Program Director or Chief Resident (Department-level)"
      department: "Internal Medicine / Pediatrics / Surgery (varies by department)"
      pain: "Residents overworked (80+ hour weeks), high burnout, documentation backlog, patient assessment takes too long"
      why_they_advocate: "Reduce burnout, improve resident retention, speed up documentation, improve patient care"
      concern: "Will this tool actually help residents learn? Will attending physicians trust AI suggestions?"
      political_position: "May fear job security or ACGME concerns"
      
    blockers:
      - title: "Medical Board / State Licensing Authority"
        objection: "AI cannot diagnose patients or make clinical decisions without MD signature. A licensed physician (attending) must review and approve all AI diagnostic suggestions. Residents are under supervision; autonomous AI may violate supervision requirements."
        concern: "Is this legally permissible in our state? What does the medical board say?"
        veto_power: "HARD VETO - state medical boards regulate medical practice"
        
      - title: "ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education)"
        objection: "Residency programs are accredited by ACGME. ACGME requires residents to participate in clinical decision-making for educational purposes. If AI replaces resident assessment, it may violate accreditation standards and endanger program accreditation."
        concern: "Will using this tool put our program at risk of losing accreditation?"
        veto_power: "HARD VETO - loss of accreditation would be catastrophic for hospital"
        
      - title: "Risk / Legal Officer"
        objection: "Liability framework is unclear. If AI contributes to patient harm, who's responsible—hospital, AI vendor, attending physician, resident, or AI developer? Malpractice carriers may not cover autonomous medical AI without clear governance."
        concern: "What's our exposure if something goes wrong? Will our insurance cover this?"
        veto_power: "SOFT VETO - malpractice carriers may refuse coverage"
        
      - title: "Chief Information Officer / EHR Leader"
        objection: "Integration with existing EHR systems (Epic, Cerner) is complex and risky. Clinical AI requires robust governance, audit trails, and security. Integration may be expensive and slow down other initiatives."
        concern: "How do we integrate this safely? What's the cost and timeline?"
        
      - title: "Patient Safety / Quality Assurance Officer"
        objection: "Autonomous AI cannot replace human judgment in complex cases, patient communication, or ethical decisions. Resident training is safety-critical; AI replacing residents may increase risk of patient harm."
        concern: "Will patients be safe? What if the AI makes a wrong diagnosis?"
        
      - title: "Implicit: Malpractice Insurance Carrier"
        objection: "Major malpractice carriers report hesitation to cover autonomous medical AI decisions. Some explicitly exclude AI-assisted diagnoses from coverage."
        concern: "Will our malpractice insurance cover this?"
        
  budget_context:

    time_wasted: "Residents spend 25-30 hours/week on documentation; administrative burden contributes to burnout"
    money_lost: "High resident attrition (30-50% of residents leave training or switch specialties due to burnout); cost to replace resident: $100K-200K (recruitment, training, lost productivity)"
    burnout_impact: "40% of healthcare workers report unsustainable workload; 60% of residents report burnout symptoms"
    resident_turnover_cost: "If 20% of residents leave early due to burnout, that's ~$2-10M in turnover costs per 100-bed hospital"

    realistic_market_opportunity: "Currently $0 (regulatory barriers prevent adoption)"
    
  scoring_summary:
    market_size_score: 5/10
      reasoning: "TAM $200M-400M is substantial, but purely theoretical. Regulatory barriers prevent market from materializing in next 3-5 years."
    icp_clarity_score: 3/10
      reasoning: "Multiple conflicting stakeholders (CMO, CFO, medical board, ACGME, risk officer, attending physicians). No single decision-maker. Budget scattered across strategic initiatives, not opex."
    regulatory_score: 1/10
      reasoning: "Medical boards, ACGME, and malpractice carriers all have veto power. Autonomous diagnosis is blocked everywhere. Would require federal legislation + state regulatory changes + insurance reform (5-10 year timeline)."
    gtm_score: 2/10
      reasoning: "Very long sales cycle (12-18 months), high touch C-suite sales, regulatory uncertainty drives churn risk, strong incumbent competition (Augmedix, EHR vendors), founder needs clinical credibility"
    founder_fit_score: 2/10
      reasoning: "Founder must be MD or healthcare executive with deep clinical credibility. Non-MDs will struggle to be taken seriously by hospital C-suite and medical staff."
      
  verdict: "HARD REJECT"
    rationale: "Burnout is real pain, but autonomous diagnosis is not the solution hospitals want and cannot legally deploy. Market is blocked by medical boards, ACGME, malpractice carriers, and patient safety concerns. Even if you build the technology, you face legal liability for patient harm. Alternative solutions (documentation automation like Augmedix, EHR improvements) are better plays but already crowded."
    
  recommendation: "Do not pursue. If interested in resident burnout, pivot to adjacent opportunities: (a) ambient clinical documentation (like Augmedix), (b) physician assistant hiring platform, (c) burnout-focused wellness programs, or (d) shift to non-clinical healthcare SaaS (revenue cycle, supply chain, prior auth). All of these are regulatory-compliant and have better unit economics."
