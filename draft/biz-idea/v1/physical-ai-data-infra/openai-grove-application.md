## Application Content

### What are you building?

I'm building a **Physical AI data infrastructure company** targeting Korea's **$1.5B physical AI initiative** in Jeollabuk-do, where Hyundai Motor (Boston Dynamics acquirer) and other major players are converging.

**For B2B sector**: 
A **Scale AI-style data labeling and dataset construction platform**, but specifically for **non-humanoid physical AI** — excavators, construction machinery, agricultural robots, and industrial automation. 

While most players focus on humanoid datasets, we're **pre-building specialized datasets for heavy machinery and other non-humanoid shapes of physical AI** to scale globally.

**For B2C**: 
Applying the **"Dubai cookie" model** — identifying sectors with structural excess demand and launching high-margin consumer products, leveraging AI for demand prediction and supply chain optimization.

**At Vibers AI** (B2B AI transformation company, Founding Engineer):
- Contributed to **$850K seed round** (Kakao Ventures)
- Led deployment of AI-driven construction SaaS for Woomi Construction
- **Reduced design quote generation time by 90%**
- Built GenAI content pipelines for K-beauty brands (25K+ followers) and Amazon e-commerce
- Reached out to client companies as a PMF member
- **Secured key enterprise skincare account**, expanding active client portfolio by ~12.5%

**At BioResearch AI** (Series B DaaS korean startup):
- Curated **domain-specific datasets for NLP engine training**
- Processed global pharmaceutical data
- Structured unstructured research papers
- Built labeled datasets that powered research automation platform
- **Directly transferable to current vision**: building specialized datasets for physical AI

**At TRIDGE** (Series D, International agriculture trading company):
- Built **agricultural data infrastructure** using Google Earth Engine Satellite data
- Crop yield prediction
- Fusioning multiple satellite data for high quality anomaly detection

### What do you hope to gain from OpenAI Grove?

1. **Technical guidance**: 
   - Recent research trends on multimodal and embodiment-focused models for physical AI applications

2. **Network**: 
   - Connections to physical AI/robotics founders 
   - Potential B2B customers in the US market

3. **Credibility**: 
   - OpenAI affiliation to strengthen partnerships with Korean conglomerates (Hyundai, construction firms) entering the physical AI space

4. **Guidance**: 
   - Mentorship on scaling data infrastructure businesses globally
   - Strategy guidance to contributing to humanity

**Vision**: "Liberating the Human Spirit from the 80%"

> Most people spend 80% of their lives managed by mundane tasks, leaving only 20% for their true passions. We don't use AI to optimize that 20%; we use it to obliterate the 80% that stands in the way. Our mission is to move beyond 'market-proven' features and address the unmeasured desires and suppressed creative fire within every individual. We aren't building for users; we are building for the dreamers who are too busy to dream.

### Is there anything else you would like us to know?

**Korea is making an unprecedented bet on physical AI** — Jeollabuk-do's $1.5B initiative with Hyundai's Boston Dynamics integration positions Korea as a global physical AI hub.

**I'm uniquely positioned at this intersection**:

1. **Dataset construction experience**: 
   - At BioResearch AI, I built the data pipeline and curated specialized datasets for NLP training
   - Understand the full lifecycle — from raw data collection to labeled, production-ready datasets
   - Now applying this to physical AI

2. **Domain expertise**: 
   - Agricultural science and Entrepreneurship degree background
   - Hands-on experience with construction AI deployment
   - **AI-native**: Learned to code from agent harness, fully obsessed with automating the development process with context engineering
   - Can interact with customers side by side

3. **Execution track record**: 
   - Built and shipped AI products across construction, K-beauty, and e-commerce in <8 months at a seed-stage startup
   - **Builder that actively reaches out to customers**, never stay behind the screens

4. **Market timing**: 
   - **First-mover advantage** in non-humanoid physical AI datasets before the market consolidates
