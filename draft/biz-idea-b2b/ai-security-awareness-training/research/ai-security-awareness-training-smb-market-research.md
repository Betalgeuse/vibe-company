## 10. Key Market Insights

### 10.1 Top 5 Market Insights

1. **SMB Training Segment Growing 5x Faster Than Enterprise**
   - SMB CAGR: 20.1% vs. Enterprise: 4-6%
   - Implication: Founder can dominate niche faster than entering enterprise segment
   - Window: 3-4 years of SMB growth before larger players consolidate the segment

2. **Regulatory Compliance is Non-Discretionary Spending**
   - 70%+ of SMBs pursuing SOC2 in 2024-2025 due to customer pressure
   - Training is 40%+ of SOC2 audit scope
   - Implication: Budget is protected; not subject to economic slowdown

3. **No Vendor has AI-Native Content Generation Yet**
   - KnowBe4 added basic AI (2024), but limited to templates
   - Cofense/Mimecast rely on manual content
   - Opportunity: First-mover advantage for AI-driven personalization (12-18 month window)

4. **SMB Sales Motion is Founder-Friendly**
   - 22-43 day sales cycles (vs. 8-16 weeks for mid-market)
   - $25-50K ACV supports founder-led sales
   - 2-4 person buying committee (not complex procurement)
   - Implication: Founder can close 5-10 customers/quarter solo

5. **Integration Burden is Surmountable (Not Barrier)**
   - SSO/HRIS integrations are standard, not differentiating
   - Compliance reporting (SOC2 templates) is core competitive advantage
   - Implication: Build AI/content first; integrations can be added later

**Critical Founder Skills for This Market:**

✅ **Required:**
- B2B SaaS sales experience (or willingness to learn)
- Understanding of compliance/security concepts (SOC2, GDPR)
- Product-market fit instinct (could iterate with early customers)

⚠️ **Nice-to-Have:**

## 11. Risk Assessment & Mitigations

### 11.1 Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
