## Conditions for Success

### Must-Have (Before Launch):

2. ✅ Recruit co-founder with AP/manufacturing background
3. ✅ Validate pricing with 15+ contract manufacturing CFOs
4. ✅ Build self-serve tier to hit 11-month payback target

### Must-Have (Months 1-6):
5. ✅ Achieve 99.5% NetSuite integration uptime with first 3 customers
6. ✅ Hire VP Sales (enterprise SaaS background)
7. ✅ Prove 80% automation rate in pilot customers

9. ✅ Begin vendor network (top 100 manufacturing suppliers)
10. ✅ Hit $150K ARR milestone

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Monitor Closely):
- **ERP integration reliability:** Single point of failure
- **Sales execution:** Requires experienced hire, can't wing it
- **Competitive response:** Bill.com could move upmarket quickly

### Medium Risk:
- **Market timing:** AP automation funding declining (but TAM growing)
- **Feature scope creep:** Must stay focused on manufacturing vertical

### Low Risk:
- Market size ✅
- Customer pain ✅
- Technical capability (with right hires) ✅

---

## Recommendation

### ✅ PROCEED with revised plan

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Vertical focus (contract manufacturing, not generic mid-market)
2. Unit economics fixed (self-serve + annual contracts)
3. ERP scope reduced (NetSuite only → expand later)
4. Team gaps addressed (advisor + VP Sales + co-founder)
5. Competitive moat roadmap (vendor network + data)

**Funding Recommendation:**
- Raise $2.4M seed round
- Use $300K for customer discovery + NetSuite integration (months 1-6)
- Hire VP Sales (month 6) only after proving pilot success
- Target Series A ($5-8M) at $600K ARR (month 18)

**Exit Scenarios:**
- Acquisition by Bill.com, AvidXchange, or NetSuite (18-36 months)
- Standalone growth to $10M ARR (4-5 years)
