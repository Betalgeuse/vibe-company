---

## Individual GTM Model Scores

### 1. Product-Led Sales (PLG + Light Sales)
**Model Definition**: Free trial → Self-upgrade → Sales assist for enterprise

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Product Fit** | 5/10 | Integration complexity creates friction; requires technical support |
| **Market Fit** | 3/10 | Finance teams need procurement approval; not self-serve buyer |
| **Unit Economics @ $3-6K ACV** | 2/10 | CAC $15-25K exceeds LTV of $54-81K; breaks at current ACV |
| **Founder Effort** | 8/10 | Low founder involvement (automated onboarding possible) |
| **Velocity (90-day GTM)** | 7/10 | Can launch quickly, but conversion rates low |

**📊 PLG Fit Score: 5.0/10** ❌

**Why PLG Fails**:
- Bill.com (dominant competitor) proves PLG alone doesn't work; they use accountant partnerships
- Chaser's success = Xero marketplace integration, not standalone PLG
- API integration + data mapping = 50%+ user abandonment rate
- Self-serve support insufficient for technical issues

**Verdict**: BROKEN at $3-6K ACV. Minimum viable ACV for PLG = $10K+.

---

### 2. Founder-Led Sales (B2B Sales Model)
**Model Definition**: Direct CFO/Finance Director outreach → Demo → Pilot → Contract

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Product Fit** | 7/10 | ROI story compelling to finance ops; founder credibility helps |
| **Market Fit** | 6/10 | Can reach ICP, but through limited channels (LinkedIn, email, events) |
| **Unit Economics @ $3-6K ACV** | 5/10 | CAC $20-30K vs LTV $108K (24mo) = marginal (1:3.6-5.4 ratio) |
| **Founder Effort** | 6/10 | Founder becomes 100% salesperson (halts product iteration) |
| **Velocity (90-day GTM)** | 6/10 | Can close 2-3 pilots in 90 days; validation possible |

**📊 Founder-Led Sales Fit Score: 6.0/10** ⚠️

**Why Founder-Led Works (Partially)**:
- Finance buyers are ROI-focused; founder can prove it
- Proven sales cycle: 45-60 days for B2B AR tools
- Can reach 50-150 emp SaaS via LinkedIn + events

**Why Founder-Led Breaks at $3-6K ACV**:
- ICP reachability problem: How do you find 50-150 emp SaaS companies?
  - LinkedIn cold DMs: 2-3% response rate
  - Email cold outreach: <5% response
  - Events/conferences: $50K+ cost, 5-10 leads
  - CAC realistically: $20-30K per customer

- Switching costs are real (customers on Bill.com/Chaser won't switch for "70% automation")

- Founder bottleneck: Can realistically close 5-8 customers/quarter
  - ARR = 20-32 customers × $4.5K = $90-144K (below $150K target)
  - Would need $10K+ ACV for viability: 15-20 customers × $10K = $150-200K

**Verdict**: VIABLE at $10K+ ACV (CAC $20-30K, LTV $240K, CAC:LTV = 1:8). BROKEN at $3-6K ACV.

---

### 3. Self-Serve + Support (Freemium Model)
**Model Definition**: 100% self-serve signups → Freemium tier → Paid unlimited tier

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Product Fit** | 6/10 | Finance teams can demo without sales; onboarding automation feasible |
| **Market Fit** | 5/10 | Depends on organic search/content; slow discovery without channels |
| **Unit Economics @ $3-6K ACV** | 6/10 | CAC $5-8K (organic), LTV $60K (12mo) = 1:7.5 ratio (healthy but requires scale) |
| **Founder Effort** | 9/10 | Lowest founder involvement; ops-heavy but leverage-able |
| **Velocity (90-day GTM)** | 3/10 | Requires 6-9 months of content/SEO work before traction |

**📊 Self-Serve Fit Score: 5.8/10** ⚠️

**Why Self-Serve Works (Long-term)**:
- Lower CAC ($5-8K vs $20-30K)
- Healthy CAC:LTV ratio (1:7.5)
- Founder can focus on product
- Sustainable if retention high (churn <3% monthly)

**Why Self-Serve Is Slow**:
- Freemium conversion: 1-3% typical
- Need 3,300-10,000 free signups to reach 100 paid customers
- Organic growth timeline: 6-12 months before meaningful traction
- Integration complexity: 50%+ abandon at "Connect to Xero" step
- Self-serve support insufficient for technical failures

**Verdict**: VIABLE LONG-TERM (18-24 months), SLOW for 90-day GTM. Requires marketplace distribution (Xero/QBO) to accelerate.

## Channel Strategy Fit Score: **7/10**

### **Accountant Partnership Channel** (Recommended First)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Access | 8/10 | Accountants have direct SMB access; proven with Bill.com (8,000+ partners) |
| Stickiness | 7/10 | Embedded in accountant workflows; high retention if value delivered |
| Unit Economics | 8/10 | Low CAC (embedded); revenue share 30-50% of ACV |
| Scalability | 6/10 | Requires partner relationship management; ~1-2 partner managers per 20 firms |
| Speed (90-day GTM) | 7/10 | Can close 2-3 partnerships in 60 days if product ready |

**Channel Score: 7.4/10** ✅ **RECOMMENDED FIRST**

**Why This Channel Works**:
- Accountants are trusted advisors to SMB finance teams
- Bill.com proved this playbook (8,000+ partners generating revenue)
- Chaser proved AR-focused integrations succeed via partnerships
- Revenue share model (30-50%) acceptable at $3-6K ACV
- Partnership ARR more predictable than organic

**Realistic Revenue**:
- 5 partnerships @ $500-1K/month each = $30-60K ARR
- 10 partnerships = $60-120K ARR
- 15 partnerships = $90-180K ARR (plateau point for solo founder + 1 ops)

---

### **Marketplace Channel** (Secondary, Conditional)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Access | 6/10 | Xero/QBO have 100K+ SMB users; algorithmic discovery possible |
| Stickiness | 5/10 | App store users = lower loyalty (easy to switch) |
| Unit Economics | 7/10 | No CAC (algorithmic discovery); 30% revenue share typical |
| Scalability | 8/10 | Scales automatically once approved; no relationship management |
| Speed (90-day GTM) | 3/10 | Approval takes 4-8 weeks; requires 10+ testimonials first |

**Channel Score: 5.8/10** ✅ **RECOMMENDED SECOND (Month 4+)**

**Why This Channel Works (Eventually)**:
- Chaser proved marketplace success (10,000+ users, Xero Partner of Year)
- Xero has 100K+ SMB users globally
- Once approved, channels users algorithmically (no sales required)
- High trust signal (Xero endorsement)

**Realistic Revenue**:
- Month 1 launch: 5-10 users/month (low interest, unknown vendor)
- Month 3: 20-30 users/month (building reviews, social proof)
- Month 6: 50-80 users/month (good reviews, featured placement possible)
- Year 1 total: 200-400 new users from marketplace

---

### **Self-Serve/Organic Channel** (Tertiary, Long-tail)

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Access | 4/10 | SEO for "AR automation SMB" = low volume (500-1K searches/month) |
| Stickiness | 5/10 | Organic users = self-motivated; higher engagement but low volume |
| Unit Economics | 6/10 | Low CAC ($3-5K); churn higher without support |
| Scalability | 6/10 | Requires content investment; non-linear growth |
| Speed (90-day GTM) | 2/10 | SEO takes 6+ months to materialize |

**Channel Score: 4.6/10** ✅ **RECOMMENDED THIRD (Month 3+)**

**Why This Channel Is Slow**:
- "AR automation" keyword = low search volume for SMBs
- "AR automation for SaaS" = even lower
- Content marketing ROI = 6-12 months
- Most valuable users already use Bill.com/Chaser

**Realistic Revenue**:
- Month 1: 0 (new domain, no SEO authority)
- Month 3: 10-20 free signups (organic search + referral)
- Month 6: 30-50 free signups/month
- Year 1: 200-300 free signups → 3-6 paid customers ($15-30K ARR)

---

## Total GTM Score: **7/10**

### Breakdown by Model
- **Sales-Led (Founder-Led)**: 6/10
- **Product-Led (PLG)**: 5/10
- **Self-Serve + Support**: 6/10
- **Accountant Partnerships**: 7.4/10 ✅
- **Marketplace (Xero/QBO)**: 5.8/10
- **Organic/Self-Serve**: 4.6/10

### **Recommended GTM (Hybrid)**: 7/10
- Month 1-2: Accountant Partnership pilot (7.4/10 channel score)
- Month 3: Launch freemium + organic (4.6/10 channel score)
- Month 4-6: Marketplace submission (5.8/10 channel score, conditional approval)

**Rationale**: Combine high-confidence channel (partnerships) with medium-risk channels (marketplace + organic). De-risks revenue while building proof for marketplace acceptance.
