## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which opportunity should we build first?**  
A: ComplianceRunner (Compliance). It has better unit economics, larger TAM, and shorter sales cycle. Validate CashLens in parallel months 3-4.

**Q: Can we build both at the same time?**  
A: Not recommended with 2-person team in months 1-4. Focus on one, validate the other, then decide. You could hire quickly if both gain traction.

**Q: What if we can't find customers in the first month?**  
A: Use the discovery call scripts in Week 0-1 validation phase. If <5 prospects interested per opportunity, pivot or iterate the hypothesis.

**Q: How accurate are these 6-month projections?**  
A: Based on comparable B2B SaaS products with similar GTM, pricing, and unit economics. Actual results will vary ±50% based on execution. Use as guide, not gospel.

**Q: What's the biggest risk for each opportunity?**  
A: Compliance: Auditor validation fails (fix: validate week 2-3). CashFlow: Stripe adds native forecasting (fix: move upmarket faster).

**Q: Can we change the pricing model?**  
A: Yes, but keep ACV in the $9-14K range for unit economics to work. Higher pricing = longer sales cycle. Lower pricing = need 50+ customers for target revenue.

**Q: What if market validation shows low demand?**  
A: If <5 prospects per opportunity show strong interest, pause and explore new hypotheses (Opportunity C, D, E from GTM analysis).
