## 🎯 Opportunity A: ComplianceRunner (SOC2/GDPR Automation)

**GTM Winner Score: 21/30 → B2B Viability: 9.2/10**

### Key Strengths
✅ **Higher Revenue**: $13.5K ACV vs $9.2K (46% more)  
✅ **Best Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC 8.2:1, Payback 2.2 months  
✅ **Larger TAM**: $1.5B+ vs $200-300M  
✅ **Shorter Sales Cycle**: 30-60 days (compliance = urgent requirement)  
✅ **Natural Moat**: AI control generation hard to copy; integrations sticky  
✅ **Expansion Path**: ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA → $400-800/mo per customer  

### Key Challenges
⚠️ **Domain Complexity**: Founder needs 2-3 weeks learning compliance  
⚠️ **Auditor Relationship**: Must validate reports with Big4 early (week 2-3)  
⚠️ **Integration Maintenance**: AWS/GitHub API changes require DevOps  
⚠️ **Smaller Early Market**: Most compliance automation go to enterprises  

### Why This Wins on Economics
- **Enterprise pull-through**: Early 15-30 person SaaS → Series B demand → $2-5K/mo deals
- **Expansion revenue**: Framework additions, module upsells = 25% NRR
- **Lower churn**: Compliance is sticky (auditors demand specific controls)

### Realistic 6-Month Outcomes
| Month | Customers | MRR | ARR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | $0 | $0 | Beta phase |
| 2 | 3 | $3K | $36K | First paid customers |
| 3 | 10-15 | $12-15K | $144-180K | Word-of-mouth adoption |
| 4 | 15-20 | $18-22K | $216-264K | SDR hiring month |
| 5 | 20-25 | $22-28K | $264-336K | Content marketing payoff |
| 6 | 25-30 | $25-35K | $300-420K | Expansion revenue starts |

## 🎯 Opportunity B: CashLens (Cash Flow Intelligence)

**Founder-Market Fit Score: 92/100 → B2B Viability: 9.0/10**

### Key Strengths
✅ **Perfect Founder Fit**: Finance expert + 10x dev = dream team (9.5/10)  
✅ **Urgent Pain**: 80% of SaaS founders manage cash in Excel (massive TAM)  
✅ **Self-Serve Motion**: Free tier → 14-day trial → paid (no sales call)  
✅ **High Engagement**: Daily logins due to forecasting need  
✅ **Network Effect**: Founder uses → refers to co-founders → viral  
✅ **Lower Support Load**: Simpler product than compliance = faster scaling  

### Key Challenges
⚠️ **Longer Sales Cycle**: 60-90 days (CFO buying cycle slower)  
⚠️ **Lower ACV**: $9.2K means need 30+ customers for $30K MRR  
⚠️ **Competitive Risk**: Stripe/Brex add forecasting natively → kills TAM  
⚠️ **Smaller TAM**: $200-300M (vs $1.5B for compliance)  
⚠️ **Higher Churn Risk**: Feature parity with spreadsheets = easy to churn  

### Why This Is High-Risk
- **Free tier cannibalization**: 50% of users may stay on free (limited revenue)
- **Commoditization**: Once Stripe adds forecasting, WTP drops 70%
- **Scaling harder**: Need 50+ customers for month-6 target vs 25 for Compliance

### Realistic 6-Month Outcomes
| Month | Customers | MRR | ARR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | $0 | $0 | Beta phase |
| 2 | 4 | $2.5K | $30K | Early adopters (heavy discount) |
| 3 | 8-12 | $6-9K | $72-108K | Content marketing ramp |
| 4 | 12-18 | $9-14K | $108-168K | Partnership referrals |
| 5 | 18-25 | $12-18K | $144-216K | Viral within founder communities |
| 6 | 20-30 | $12-18K | $144-216K | **Churn starts (free tier effect)** |

## 🏆 RECOMMENDATION: DUAL TRACK STRATEGY

Rather than picking one, I recommend this approach:

### **Months 1-4: Focus on ComplianceRunner (Primary)**
- **Rationale**: Better unit economics, shorter sales cycle, higher conviction
- **Allocation**: 70% of energy
- **Goal**: 10-15 paying customers, validate $15K+ ACV

### **Months 3-4: Validate CashLens (Parallel)**
- **Rationale**: Run 15-20 founder discovery calls; validate unit economics
- **Allocation**: 30% of energy (evenings/weekends)
- **Decision Point (Month 4)**: Go/No-Go based on discovery feedback

### **Month 5+: Scale Winner or Pivot**
- **If ComplianceRunner winning**: Hire SDR, scale to $30K+ MRR
- **If CashLens showing promise**: Switch primary focus, hire product designer
- **If neither winning**: Pause, iterate, or explore Opportunity C/D

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### ComplianceRunner Must-Haves

### CashLens Must-Haves
1. **Week 4-5**: Test forecast accuracy vs actual (error < 10%)
