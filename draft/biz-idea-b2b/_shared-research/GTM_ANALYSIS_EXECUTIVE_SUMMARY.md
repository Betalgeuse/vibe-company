## 💰 KEY FINANCIAL REALITY-CHECKS

### ACV Reality: $6K-12K (Not $8K-18K)
**Analysis**:
| Benchmark | Annual Cost | Per-Employee |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Gusto | $4.8K | $96 |
| BambooHR | $6.6K-12K | $132-240 |
| Rippling | $4.8K-7.2K | $96-144 |
| **Your Target** | **$6K-12K realistic** | **$120-240** |
| Your Aspirational | $8K-18K | $160-360 |

**Verdict**: $8K-18K = top 10% deals only (Series A/B tech). Realistic median = $9K.

---

### CAC Reality: $1K-1.5K (Not <$500)
**Breakdown**:
- LinkedIn Navigator: $500/mo + 10 hrs founder time = $500-1K CAC
- Cold email (Apollo): $500/mo + 3K-5K emails to land 1 customer = $1K-1.5K CAC
- Google Ads (HR keywords): $40-80 CPC × 10-20 clicks/customer = $800-1.5K CAC

**Why <$500 unrealistic**: HR buyers hard to reach, cold email 1-3% reply rate, 45-90 day sales cycle = high founder time cost.

**CAC Progression**:
| Phase | CAC | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Month 1-2 | $2K-2.5K | High founder effort; low leverage |
| Month 3-4 | $1.5K-2K | Inbound starting to ramp |
| Month 5-6 | $1K-1.5K | Referral + product-market fit validation |
| Month 7-12 | $800-1.2K | SDR hire; multiple channels active |

---

### Unit Economics Check
```
ACV: $9,000 (median)
LTV: $22,500 (2.5 year retention, 15% churn)
CAC: $1,200 (Year 1 blended)

CAC:LTV Ratio = 1:18.75 ✅ (target ≥1:3)
Payback Period = 12/9 × 1.2 = 16 months ✅ (within 18-24 month range)
```

## 📈 YEAR 1 TARGETS

### Customer Acquisition
| Month | Customers | ARR | CAC | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----|-------|

| 3-4 | 8 | $72-144K | $1.5K | Founder outreach scales + inbound ramps |
| 5-6 | 10 | $150-300K | $1K-1.5K | Community + referral leverage |
| 7-12 | 15 | $200-380K | $800-1.2K | SDR hire; professional sales org |

**Year 1 Total**: 25-35 customers | $150-300K ARR (gross) | $125-250K (net after churn)

## 🔌 FIRST 10 CUSTOMERS STRATEGY

### Customer Segment
- **Target**: Series A/B tech companies (50-150 employees)
- **Triggers**: Recent 10x growth (50→100 emp), high turnover, remote/hybrid hiring
- **Pain**: $175K HR time waste + $420-600K turnover cost annually

### Customer 1-3 (Month 1-2)
- **Tactic**: Founder warm intros + cold outreach (highest effort)
- **Offer**: Free onboarding setup (founder time) + custom integrations (up to 5 hours)
- **Risk removal**: 30-day money-back guarantee
- **Success metric**: Customer onboards 2-3 new hires in first month

### Customer 4-6 (Month 2-3)
- **Tactic**: Reference calls from Customer 1-3 (social proof)
- **Offer**: Case study publication (LinkedIn, G2 visibility)
- **Referral**: $500 bonus for each referral
- **Pricing**: Standardize at $8K-10K (no custom discounting)

### Customer 7-10 (Month 3-4)
- **Tactic**: Community + cold email + PH follow-up (multi-channel)
- **Offer**: Video testimonials from early customers (LinkedIn case studies)
- **Community**: Authentic participation in HR Tech Slack, Reddit, founder groups
- **Referral**: Expand program; expect 2-3 referred deals by Month 4

### Launch Vehicle
**Recommended**: Community-first → Product Hunt (Week 1-2) → Parallel cold outreach
- Launch in HR Tech communities first (seed social proof)
- Product Hunt launch (high visibility)
- Leverage PH credibility for cold outreach ("Featured on Product Hunt")

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Founder Burnout (Month 4-6) 🔴 HIGH LIKELIHOOD
**Problem**: 5-10 demos/week + product dev = 30+ hrs/week → quality suffers

**Mitigation**:
1. Hire VA Month 3 ($1K/mo) for research + list building (not demos)
2. Time-box sales at 20 hrs/week (rest on product/ops)
3. SDR hire planned Month 6 (non-negotiable)
4. Expect pipeline decline Month 5-6; recovery Month 8-9 with SDR

---

### Risk 2: ACV Drops Below $6K 🔴 MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD
**Problem**: Market pressure forces discounting; unit economics break

**Mitigation**:
1. Pricing discipline: Never discount below $6K (walk away from deals)
2. Value articulation: Quantify $420-600K turnover savings
3. Upsell modules: Post-onboarding AI support, offboarding (expand ACV)
4. Segment up-market: If downmarket too competitive, focus on Series A/B tech

**Unit Economics Red Line**: ACV < $5K → CAC:LTV < 1:3 ❌ (unsustainable)

---

### Risk 3: Competitor Response 🟡 MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD (40%)
**Problem**: BambooHR adds IT provisioning; kills your differentiation (12-18 months)

**Mitigation**:
1. Move fast: Get 100+ customers, $500K ARR by Month 18 (defensible scale)
2. Build AI moat: AI assistant + personalization (hard to copy)
3. Customer lock-in: Data in system = high switching cost (90% locked)
4. Acquisition target: Become attractive to BambooHR, ADP, or private equity

---

### Risk 4: Sales Cycle Extends to 120+ Days 🟡 MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD (30%)
**Problem**: Security reviews, compliance delays extend cycle beyond 90 days

**Mitigation**:
1. Sales qualification: Disqualify 90+ day deals early (ask in discovery)
2. Security pre-qualification: Ask about SAML, compliance upfront
3. CTC approach: Security reviews okay IF customer commits to 60-day trial
4. Pipeline planning: Build 3x overdue to smooth revenue

---

## ❌ WHY OTHER MODELS DON'T WORK

### Self-Serve Only ❌
- Trial-to-paid conversion <5% (breaks unit economics)
- IT provisioning requires guidance (not self-serve)
- Verdict: Add founder sales to convert (becomes founder-led model)

### Partner-First ❌
- 6-12 month ramp (too slow for Year 1 revenue)
- Competitive conflict (BambooHR, Gusto have onboarding)
- Revenue share 15-30% eats margins
- Verdict: Viable Year 2+, not Year 1

### Content Marketing ❌
- 6-12 month ramp (no Year 1 revenue from SEO)
- HR Tech SEO competitive ($5K-10K/month investment)
- Verdict: Start Month 6, ramps Month 12+ (long-tail play)

---

## ✅ GO/NO-GO CHECKLIST

**PROCEED IF ALL TRUE**:
- ✅ Founder committed to 6-month sales push (5-10 demos/week)
- ✅ Realistic ACV target ($6K-12K, not $18K aspirational)
- ✅ SDR hire planned Month 6 (transition non-negotiable)
- ✅ Product delivers on demo (IT provisioning smooth, AI functional)
- ✅ Realistic Year 1 target (25-35 customers, not 100+)
- ✅ 18-24 month runway to profitability (no faster)

**REJECT IF ANY TRUE**:
- ❌ Founder not willing to do sales (prefers pure product building)
- ❌ Expecting ACV >$15K from majority of SMBs (unrealistic)
- ❌ No plan to hire SDR by Month 7 (founder burnout incoming)
- ❌ Product not ready for live demos (weak integrations or AI)
- ❌ Expecting >50 customers Year 1 (founder bottleneck inevitable)

## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**GTM FIT**: ✅ **CONDITIONAL PASS (24/30)**

**Status**: **GO** with conditions

**Primary Model**: Founder-Led Sales (Month 1-6) transitioning to SDR-led (Month 7-12)

**Year 1 Target**: 25-35 customers | $150-300K ARR (gross) | $125-250K (net of churn)

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. Founder commits to high-touch sales
2. ACV discipline ($6K-12K, no discounting)
3. Product delivers on promise
4. SDR hire non-negotiable Month 6
5. Realistic expectations (25-35 customers, not moonshot targets)

**Biggest Execution Risks**:
1. 🔴 Founder burnout (Month 4-6) → mitigate with VA + SDR hire
2. 🔴 ACV compression (competition) → mitigate with pricing discipline + upsell
3. 🔴 Competitor response → mitigate with speed to market + AI differentiation moat

**Timeline to Profitability**:
- Month 6-8: Break-even on COGS
- Month 12-15: Cash-flow positive
- Month 18-24: Sustainable growth phase

**Next Step**: Validate with first 3 customers; adjust model Month 2 based on real sales data.
