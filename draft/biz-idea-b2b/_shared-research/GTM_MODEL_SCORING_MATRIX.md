## 🔴 MODEL 1: PRODUCT-LED SALES (PLG + Light Sales)
**Score: 5.7/10** | **Status: NOT RECOMMENDED AS PRIMARY**

### Detailed Scoring

#### Product Fit (Can onboarding be self-serve?) - 5/10
**Positive Factors** ✅:
- Visual dashboard + checklist = immediately understandable value
- Free trial demonstrable (can show with dummy data)
- Low barrier to adoption (staff can figure out basics)

**Negative Factors** ❌:
- IT provisioning integrations NOT self-serve (requires guide)
- Buying committee friction (VP People + CFO can't both trial alone)
- Value requires live hire event (timing dependency; can't trial on-demand)
- Trial-to-paid conversion low for HR SaaS (5-10% benchmark)
- Self-serve users less engaged (churn 40-50% ARR vs 15-20% for high-touch)

**Verdict**: Onboarding software CAN have trials, but has fundamental self-serve friction.

---

#### Sales Cycle Alignment (45-90 days target) - 5/10
**Model Cycle**: 60-120 days (longer than target)

**Why Extends Cycle**:
1. Trial inertia: SMB users start trial but delay decision (low urgency in free trial)
2. No top-of-funnel salesperson: PLG relies on self-initiated demand (unpredictable timing)
3. Buying committee not engaged until decision: VP People trials, but CFO only engages at closing (adds 2-3 weeks)
4. Integration anxiety: Trial users abandon when they hit integration wall (creates extended "consideration" phase)

**Benchmark Comparison**:
- BambooHR (self-serve dominant): 30-45 days
- Rippling (high-touch sales): 90-180 days
- PLG + light sales model: 60-120 days (hybrid, tends toward longer)

---

#### CAC Feasibility (Target <$3K; Realistic $1-1.5K) - 5/10
**Theoretical CAC**: $1-2K  
**Actual CAC**: $2-3K+ (due to low conversion)

**Calculation**:
```
Scenario: PLG-dominant approach
├─ Product Hunt launch: 100 trials → 1% conversion = 1 customer
├─ Organic search: 0 trials (first month); ramps Month 6
├─ Paid ads: $500/month → 10-15 trials → 0.5-1 customer
├─ Community/referral: 0 (pre-scale)
└─ Total Month 1: 2-3 customers from ~120 trials
   CAC = (PH effort $0 + ads $500 + founder support) / 2-3 customers
   CAC = $1.5K-2K per customer (assumes founder does light support on 30-50 trials)
```

**Why CAC Creeps**:
1. Trial volume high, but conversion low (1-2%) = need massive volume for revenue
2. Founder support required to convert trials (can't be hands-off) = CAC hidden in founder time
3. Light sales = still requires engagement (SDR follow-up, demo support) = CAC rises
4. Volume-heavy = support burden (community/forum responses, email support)

**Blended CAC at Scale**: $2-3K (not <$1K achievable)

---

#### Founder Effort: Sustainability - 7/10
**Weekly Effort**: 10-15 hours (relatively low)

**Breakdown**:
- Trial follow-up emails: 5 hrs/week (automated templates + manual followup)
- Demo/support calls: 5-10 hrs/week (light touch; only for high-intent trials)
- Operations: 5 hrs/week (customer onboarding, troubleshooting)

**Sustainability**: ✅ YES, sustainable for 12+ months (not exhausting)

**BUT** ❌ **Conversion dependency**: If trial-to-paid drops below 5%, founder effort increases (more follow-up needed) = becomes unsustainable.

---

#### Customer Stickiness (Switching costs, churn, expansion) - 6/10
**Switching Cost**: MEDIUM (low investment in trial → higher churn risk)

**Churn Rate**: 15-25% ARR (higher than founder-led due to weaker onboarding)

**Expansion Potential**: MEDIUM (trial users less likely to buy add-ons vs high-touch customers)

**Why Stickiness is Mediocre**:
1. Free trial attracts price-sensitive buyers (more likely to churn)
2. Less founder engagement = weaker customer success (defaults to self-serve support)
3. No relationship-based loyalty (trial-to-paid user has no personal connection)

---

#### Time to Scale - 6/10
**Scaling Mechanics**:
- Paid ads (Google, LinkedIn): Can scale 2x/month (budget increase)
- Organic (referral, community): Slow ramp (requires 6+ months reputation building)
- Product Hunt: One-time event (limited repeatable volume)

**Bottleneck**: Paid acquisition (Google Ads) is only scalable channel, but:
- CPCs high for HR keywords ($50-100+)
- Conversion rates declining (declining ROAS after initial winners)
- Not sustainable at scale (GMV efficiency poor for $8K ACV)

**Realistic Scale**:
- Year 1: 20-30 customers (limited by channel efficiency)
- Year 2: 50-70 customers (if paid ads scale, heavy CAC spending)

---

### Critical Risks

1. **Trial-to-paid bottleneck**: If conversion stays at 5%, need 10,000+ trials/month to hit 50 customers → unsustainable volume
2. **Free tier cannibalization**: SMBs stick on free tier indefinitely; churn on paid tier (poor LTV)
3. **Support burden scales with trials**: 1,000 trials/month = support burden (forum, email, chat) even if only 10 convert
4. **No buying committee alignment**: VP People trials independently; CFO never sees product → surprise objections at close

---

### Verdict
**Recommended**: NO (as primary)  
**Alternative**: Use as secondary channel AFTER founder-led sales establishes PMF (Month 6+)

**Reasoning**: PLG-only will result in low conversion (5-10%), high CAC ($2-3K), and extended sales cycles (90-120 days). Better to combine with founder sales to accelerate conversion.

---

## 🟢 MODEL 2: FOUNDER-LED SALES
**Score: 7.2/10** | **Status: 🏆 RECOMMENDED PRIMARY**

### Detailed Scoring

#### Product Fit (High-touch required?) - 8/10
**Why Strong Fit**:
1. ✅ IT provisioning complexity = founder credibility required (not self-explanatory)
2. ✅ Buying committee alignment = founder can address both VP People + CFO concerns
3. ✅ Customization expectations = founder can discuss trade-offs (features, timeline)
4. ✅ Integration concerns = founder can provide technical assurance
5. ✅ Trust at stake = "will this break our IT?" = founder relationship key

**Evidence**:
- Rippling's success = founder-led sales for complex product (founder James Ryebak sells strategically)
- BambooHR's sales = "light sales" model (founders involved in enterprise deals, not self-serve only)
- Gusto's success = founder-led for payroll (trust critical)

---

#### Sales Cycle Alignment (45-90 days target) - 8/10
**Model Cycle**: 60-80 days (within target, shorter than baseline)

**Why Founder Accelerates**:
1. Personal relationship = faster trust building (Day 1 vs Week 2)
2. Discovery depth = fewer surprises later (reduces extended evaluation)
3. CFO conversation = founder can do ROI math in real-time (speeds CFO approval)
4. Customization clarity = founder can scope integration work (removes blocker)

**Breakdown**:
```
Week 1-2:  Outreach + initial conversation
Week 3-4:  Demo + trial setup
Week 5-6:  Evaluation + integration testing (founder assist)
Week 7-8:  CFO review + approval (founder presents ROI)
Week 9:    Contract + onboarding
Total:     60-65 days (faster than self-serve 90-120 days)
```

---

#### CAC Feasibility (Target <$3K; Realistic $1-1.5K) - 8/10
**Realistic CAC**: $1K-1.5K ✅ ACHIEVABLE

**Calculation**:
```
Week 1: Founder reaches out to 50 targets (LinkedIn + email)
├─ LinkedIn (warm intros + cold 1st degree): 30 → 5-10 replies (15-30%)
├─ Cold email: 20 → 0-1 replies (0-5%)
├─ Total replies: 5-11 qualified conversations
└─ Demo conversion: 50% = 2.5-5.5 demos booked

Week 2-4: Run demos (2-3 per week)
├─ Demo-to-trial: 75-100% (high-quality leads only)
├─ Trial-to-paid: 30-50% (founder follow-up assist + product quality)
├─ Customer conversions: 0.5-1 customer per week = 2-4/month

Month cost:
├─ LinkedIn Navigator: $500
├─ Apollo/email tool: $500
├─ Founder time: 20 hours @ $75/hr opportunity cost = $1,500
├─ Total cost: $2,500 for 2-4 customers
└─ CAC = $2,500 ÷ 3 customers = ~$833/customer (scales to $1K-1.5K)
```

**CAC Progression** (as process improves):
- Month 1-2: $1.5K-2K (discovery phase, high effort per deal)
- Month 3-4: $1.2K-1.5K (process tightens, messaging refines)
- Month 5-6: $1K-1.2K (inbound + referral leverage improves)

**Why This Works**: Founder time is high but per-customer conversion is high (30-50% trial-to-paid vs 5-10% PLG-only).

---

#### Founder Effort: Sustainability - 6/10
**Weekly Effort**: 25-30 hours (moderate-to-high)

**Breakdown**:
- Outreach (research, personalization): 5-7 hrs/week
- Demos + calls: 8-10 hrs/week (5 demos × 1.5-2 hrs each + prep)
- Trial support + follow-up: 5-8 hrs/week
- Operations: 5-7 hrs/week (onboarding, product work on hold)

**Sustainability Concern**: ⚠️ Unsustainable past Month 6

**Why Burnout Risk**:
1. 25-30 hrs/week sales + product development = no time for strategic work
2. Repetitive demos = mental fatigue (same message 5x/week)
3. Rejection (70-75% no-closes) = emotional toll
4. Pipeline management = requires discipline to avoid feast/famine cycles

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Hire SDR by Month 7 (non-negotiable)
- ✅ Hire VA Month 3 for research/list (frees 5-7 hrs/week)
- ✅ Time-box at 20 hrs/week (rest on product/ops)

---

#### Customer Stickiness (Switching costs, churn, expansion) - 8/10
**Switching Cost**: MEDIUM-HIGH (founder relationship + data + staff training)

**Churn Rate**: 10-15% ARR (lower than PLG due to high-touch onboarding + relationship)

**Expansion Potential**: HIGH (founder knows customer deeply, can sell add-ons)

**Why Stickiness is Strong**:
1. Personal relationship = harder to churn (founder is relationship anchor)
2. Integration investment = high switching cost (data migration, retraining)
3. Success orientation = founder helps customer succeed (better NPS/retention)
4. Upsell opportunities = founder understands customer needs (knows when to expand)

---

#### Time to Scale - 5/10
**Scaling Mechanics**:
- Founder capacity bottleneck: 5 demos/week = 20-25 demos/month = 7-12 conversions/month (assuming 30-40% close rate)
- Monthly capacity: ~10 new customers/month (founder ceiling)
- Year 1 capacity: 60-80 customers (founder only)

**Reality**: Founder does 5-10 demos/week = 20-40 demos/month = 6-15 conversions = actual 10-20 customers/month realistically

**Bottleneck**: Founder is bottleneck; hit ceiling Month 6 without SDR/BDR hire

**Scale Path**:
1. Month 1-6: Founder does all sales (10-15 customers/month possible)
2. Month 7: SDR hire (scales to 3x capacity)
3. Month 8+: SDR + founder (40-50 customers/month possible)

---

### Critical Risks

1. **Founder burnout (Month 4-6)**: Unsustainable 25-30 hrs/week beyond 6 months
2. **Product dependency**: Weak product = founder can't sell it (no amount of charisma fixes bad UX)
3. **Limited by founder bandwidth**: Can't exceed 10-15 customers/month without SDR
4. **Founder transition risk**: If founder steps back, company loses credibility anchor

---

### Verdict
**Recommended**: YES (as primary, Month 1-6)

**Conditions**:
- ✅ Founder willing to do high-touch sales (not just product work)
- ✅ Product delivers on demo promises
- ✅ SDR hire non-negotiable Month 7
- ✅ Realistic Year 1 target: 25-35 customers (not 100+)

**Reasoning**: Best fit for complex product + high-touch buyer. Founder credibility accelerates cycle. Sustainable only 6 months; plan SDR hire non-negotiable.

---

## 🔴 MODEL 3: SELF-SERVE PLUS (Freemium + Optional Support)
**Score: 4.5/10** | **Status: NOT RECOMMENDED**

### Detailed Scoring

#### Product Fit (Self-serve friendly?) - 3/10
**Why Poor Fit**:
1. ❌ Core differentiator (IT provisioning) locked behind paid tier
2. ❌ Free tier becomes "task list app" (not differentiated from basic tools)
3. ❌ Value not apparent in free tier (can't show AI assistant without live hire)
4. ❌ Compliance requirements (I-9/eVerify) require paid tier = no meaningful free experience
5. ❌ Free tier low stickiness (users don't invest time if limited features)

**Free Tier Value Prop Problem**:
- Free users can: Create onboarding checklists, basic workflows, document upload
- Free users can't: Provision IT, use AI assistant, verify I-9, integrate with HRIS
- Result: Free tier looks basic (no differentiation vs Excel/Asana)

---

#### Sales Cycle Alignment (45-90 days target) - 3/10
**Model Cycle**: 120-180 days (very long)

**Why Extended**:
1. Free tier adoption slow (low urgency, voluntary adoption)
2. Value only apparent after 4-8 weeks of active use
3. Upgrade decision late in cycle (only after hitting free tier limits)
4. No relationship anchor (no salesperson driving timeline)

**Benchmark**: Freemium models typical 120-180 day cycle (much longer than target)

---

#### CAC Feasibility (Target <$3K) - 4/10
**Realistic CAC**: $2K-4K+ (POOR)

**Why High**:
```
Scenario: Freemium approach
├─ Free signups needed: 500-1000/month (to yield 5-10 upgrades)
├─ Paid conversions: 1-2% of free users = 5-10 upgrades/month
├─ CAC = marketing cost to drive 500-1000 signups / 5-10 conversions
├─ CAC = $1,000 (marketing) ÷ 7.5 conversions = $133 each
└─ BUT: Add support burden (email, chat, community) = hidden CAC cost
   Total implied CAC: $2-4K (support cost amortized)
```

**Why Freemium CAC is Bad**:
1. High volume, low conversion = lots of support for free tier (unmonetized)
2. Churn of free users high (60-80%) = marketing waste
3. Only valuable if growth viral (unlikely for B2B HR tool)

---

#### Founder Effort: Sustainability - 8/10
**Weekly Effort**: 10-12 hours (low founder sales effort)

**Why Low**:
1. Minimal sales team needed (mostly community/support)
2. Growth via product + marketing (not founder demos)
3. Scalable without founder (unlike founder-led sales)

**BUT** ❌ **Support burden**: Freemium models require 24/7 support (forum, chat, community) = unsustainable long-term without CS team hire

---

#### Customer Stickiness (Switching costs, churn, expansion) - 5/10
**Switching Cost**: LOW (free tier users minimal investment)

**Churn Rate**: 40-50% ARR (very high; free tier churn alone is 60-80%, paid tier 10-15%)

**Expansion Potential**: MEDIUM (some free users upgrade, most stay free indefinitely)

**Why Stickiness Poor**:
1. Free tier users have low data investment (easy to abandon)
2. Freemium competition (many free onboarding tools exist)
3. Perceived risk: "If free tier exists, why pay?" (downward pressure on ARPU)

---

#### Time to Scale - 4/10
**Scaling Mechanics**:
- Volume-dependent (need 10,000+ free signups to generate 100-200 paid customers)
- Marketing-driven (need $10-20K/month marketing budget to sustain growth)
- Network effects weak (low viral coefficient for B2B HR tool)

**Reality**: Freemium scales only if:
1. Viral growth (not likely for onboarding tool)
2. Massive marketing budget (unsustainable for bootstrap startup)
3. High paid conversion (if 3-5%, not 1-2%)

---

### Critical Risks

1. **Freemium trap**: 95% users on free tier; only 5% convert (poor unit economics)
2. **Support burden scales with free users**: Free signups = support requests (no revenue)
3. **Cannibalization**: Free tier competes with own paid offering (downward pressure on pricing)
4. **Cash flow problem**: CAC > LTV in early phase (only sustainable at $10M+ ARR scale with brand)

---

### Verdict
**Recommended**: NO

**Alternative**: Only viable if combined with founder-led sales to convert free users (then becomes Model 2 with added friction).

**Reasoning**: Freemium alone creates poor unit economics (1-2% conversion, high support burden). Self-serve alone insufficient for $8K ACV.

---

## 🟡 MODEL 4: CHANNEL PARTNER (HRIS/Payroll Ecosystem)
**Score: 4.8/10** | **Status: SECONDARY (Month 7+)**

### Detailed Scoring

#### Product Fit (Natural partner opportunity?) - 6/10
**Why Moderate Fit**:
1. ✅ HRIS partners (BambooHR, Gusto) already sell to SMBs
2. ✅ Onboarding = core HRIS workflow (natural adjacent product)
3. ❌ Partners have competing products (BambooHR + Gusto both have onboarding)
4. ❌ Partner incentive misaligned (they'd rather upsell their own onboarding than refer)
5. ❌ Distribution not exclusive (partners work with multiple competitors)

**Competitive Conflict**:
- BambooHR: Has onboarding; would integrate IT provisioning in-house (not refer to you)
- Gusto: Has basic onboarding; would build not partner
- ADP: Too large; won't ref start-up (wants to build/acquire)

---

#### Sales Cycle Alignment (45-90 days target) - 2/10
**Total Cycle**: 180-270 days (very long)

**Breakdown**:
- Partner agreement negotiation: 30-60 days
- Legal + pricing terms: 30-45 days
- Partner training + enablement: 30-45 days
- Partner selling to their customer: 45-90 days
- Your onboarding of partner customer: 30-45 days

**Total**: 165-270 days to first customer

**Verdict**: Partner channel too slow for Year 1 GTM

---

#### CAC Feasibility (Target <$3K) - 6/10
**Partner CAC**: Blended $2-3K (via revenue share)

**Model**:
```
Partner revenue share: 20% (partner gets; you get 80%)
Customer LTV: $20K (over 2.5 years)
You receive: $16K
Partner CAC: Blended $2-3K (partner's acquisition cost to you)
```

**Reality**: Partner has their own CAC to acquire customers; you don't pay directly, but revenue share is your "CAC cost".

**vs Direct CAC**: $1-1.5K (direct founder sales) >> Blended $2-3K via partner (economically worse)

---

#### Founder Effort: Sustainability - 6/10
**Weekly Effort**: 10-15 hours (moderate)

**Breakdown**:
- Partner recruitment: 5-10 hrs/month (first 3 months only)
- Partner training/enablement: 5 hrs/week (first month, then ongoing)
- Partner support: 5 hrs/week (customer escalations, content)
- Operations: 5 hrs/week

**Sustainability**: ✅ Sustainable, but requires partner management discipline

---

#### Customer Stickiness (Switching costs, churn, expansion) - 6/10
**Switching Cost**: MEDIUM (partner relationship = less direct stickiness)

**Churn Rate**: 15-20% ARR (higher than founder-led due to weaker relationship)

**Expansion Potential**: LOW (partner manages upsell, not your team)

**Why**: Partner customers don't know you; less likely to adopt add-ons

---

#### Time to Scale - 3/10
**Scaling Mechanics**:
- Depends entirely on partner performance (not in your control)
- Partner prioritization risk (if you're small, you're deprioritized)
- Multiple partner pilots needed (don't rely on single partner)

**Realistic Scale**:
- Partner 1: 0-5 customers Month 6-12 (ramp slow)
- Partner 2: 0-3 customers Month 8-12 (later start)
- Partner model: 5-10 customers Year 1 (not primary GTM)

---

### Critical Risks

1. **Partner dependency**: If partner deprioritizes, channel dies
2. **Competitive conflict**: Partner has competing onboarding product (won't ref aggressively)
3. **Revenue compression**: 20% partner cut = lower margins early (need $150K+ ARR to survive)
4. **Customer relationship loss**: You don't directly interface with customer (weaker feedback loop, harder to retain)
5. **Long ramp**: 6-12 months before first revenue (not viable for Year 1)

---

### Verdict
**Recommended**: CONDITIONAL (Month 7+, as secondary channel only)

**Conditions**:
- ✅ Primary GTM (founder-led) must establish PMF first (Month 4-6)
- ✅ Select 1-2 high-volume partner pilots only
- ✅ Revenue share capped at 20% (not 25-30%)
- ✅ Use as customer expansion channel (sell add-ons to partner customers, not acquisition)

**Reasoning**: Too slow for Y1 launch GTM. Viable for long-term scale but requires proven PMF first. Better as customer expansion channel than new customer acquisition.

---

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### Primary GTM Model: FOUNDER-LED SALES (Model 2)
**Score**: 7.2/10 (vs 5.7, 4.5, 4.8 for alternatives)
