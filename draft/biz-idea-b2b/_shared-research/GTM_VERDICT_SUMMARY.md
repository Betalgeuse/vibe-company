## 🚨 THREE CRITICAL RISKS (Unresolved)

### Risk #1: Data Privacy Trust (**CRITICAL**)
- **Problem:** Will law firms upload live client contracts to your AI platform?
- **Evidence:** 79% of lawyers avoid using AI daily (Bloomberg Law, 2025)
- **Mitigation required:** Get 5-10 pilot customers with live contracts before scaling sales
- **Status:** UNVALIDATED

### Risk #2: AI Accuracy (**CRITICAL**)
- **Problem:** Claim 70-80% accuracy; legal work requires 95%+ to eliminate manual review
- **Evidence:** Kira Systems achieves 90-95% accuracy after extensive training
- **Mitigation required:** Invest 50-100 hours per customer in legal-domain fine-tuning
- **Status:** Achievable in 18 months, not 3 months

### Risk #3: Competitive Response (**HIGH**)
- **Problem:** Ironclad can move downmarket in 12-18 months if you prove market works
- **Evidence:** Ironclad starting pricing ~$60K/year; can easily launch $25K SMB tier
- **Mitigation required:** Plan for acquisition exit (Ironclad, DocuSign, Litera), not infinite business
- **Status:** Market window is 18-24 months, not infinite

## ❌ MAJOR PLANNING MISTAKES IN ORIGINAL GTM

| Claim | Reality | Gap |
|-------|---------|-----|
| "2-4 week deployment" | 8-12 weeks realistic (legal compliance + integration + training) | 2-3x underestimate |
| "3-5 customers by M12" | 2-3 customers realistic (4-8 month sales cycles) | 50-100% overestimate |
| "70-80% AI accuracy sufficient" | Need 85-90% to avoid 100% manual review | Accuracy too low |
| "$75K MRR by M12" | $40-60K realistic (2-3 customers × $20K ACV) | 25-50% overestimate |
| "Founder sales doesn't hit bottleneck" | Founder handles 4-6 demos/week = 2-3 deals/year max | Bandwidth underestimated |

---

## ✅ WHAT WORKS (Keep These)

1. **Market is real:** 76% of law firms increasing AI budgets; pain is quantifiable
2. **GTM model is sound:** Hybrid founder-led sales + case study expansion is appropriate for legal market
3. **Unit economics are viable:** LTV:CAC 3-5:1 is healthy; CAC $10K is achievable
4. **ACV is realistic:** $15K-$30K is right price point for mid-market law firms
5. **Sales cycle is achievable:** 4-8 months is realistic (not 2-4 months, but achievable)

---

## 📅 REALISTIC 18-MONTH TIMELINE

| Period | Goal | Reality Check |
|--------|------|---|
| **M1-4** | Build MVP, validate AI accuracy (85%+), validate legal compliance timeline | ✅ Achievable |
| **M5-8** | Close 1 pilot customer (redacted contracts), iterate AI | ✅ Realistic |
| **M9-12** | Close 2-3 paying customers at $20K ACV | ✅ Achievable if M5-8 proves concept |
| **M13-18** | Scale to 10-15 customers, reach $300K ARR | ✅ Realistic with 1 SDR hire |
| **M18+** | Plan acquisition exit OR Series A (if market still open) | ✅ Most likely path |

**M12 Reality:** $40-60K ARR (not $75K) + 2-3 customer contracts signed

## 🎬 GO/NO-GO DECISION FRAMEWORK

### PROCEED IF:
1. ✅ Law firm pilots (5-10) confirm willingness to upload live contracts
2. ✅ AI achieves 85%+ accuracy on real customer contracts
3. ✅ First customer closes in 4-8 months (not faster)
4. ✅ You're comfortable with 50/50 founder time split for 18 months
5. ✅ You view business as acquisition exit (not IPO)

### DO NOT PROCEED IF:
1. ❌ Data privacy concerns kill pilot adoption (<50% pilots convert)
2. ❌ AI accuracy stays below 80% even after fine-tuning
3. ❌ First customer takes 10+ months (extends runway risk)
4. ❌ You want founder-focused product building (sales will consume 50% time)
5. ❌ You believe market will stay uncompetitive (Ironclad will move down-market)

## 📊 THREE SCENARIOS (By Probability)

### Base Case: 60% Probability → $600K ARR by Y3
- **Y1:** 2-3 customers, $40-60K ARR
- **Y2:** 12 customers, $240K ARR
- **Y3:** 30 customers, $600K ARR
- **Exit:** Acquired by Ironclad/DocuSign at $20-40M (year 2-3)

### Best Case: 20% Probability → $1M ARR by Y3
- **Y1:** 5 customers, $100K ARR (aggressive)
- **Y2:** 18 customers, $360K ARR
- **Y3:** 50 customers, $1M ARR
- **Exit:** Series A at $5-10M valuation OR acquisition at $50M+

### Worst Case: 20% Probability → Shutdown by Y3
- **Y1:** 1 customer, $20K ARR (slow sales)
- **Y2:** 4 customers, $80K ARR (churn > acquisition)
- **Y3:** Stagnation, shutdown or pivot
- **Exit:** No exit (company winds down)

**Expected value (weighted): $600K ARR by Y3, acquisition exit**

## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS (Pre-Build Validation)

### Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Interview 10 law firms: "Would you upload live contracts to AI platform?"
- [ ] Test AI accuracy on 50+ real contracts
- [ ] Map deployment timeline: Will IT review really take 4-6 weeks?
- [ ] Validate pricing: Annual ($15K) vs. per-contract ($40/contract)?

### Phase 2: MVP Validation (Weeks 5-16)
- [ ] Build MVP with 85%+ accuracy on trained clauses
- [ ] Get SOC2 Type II certification
- [ ] Partner with 2-3 law firms for pilot programs (redacted contracts OK)
- [ ] Draft case study from pilot results

### Phase 3: Sales Validation (Weeks 17-24)
- [ ] Close first 1-2 real customers (live contracts)
- [ ] Validate 4-8 month sales cycles
- [ ] Gather customer feedback on accuracy, adoption
- [ ] Hire SDR or sales contractor

### Phase 4: Scale & Exit Planning (Months 7-18)
- [ ] Scale to 10-15 customers
- [ ] Build 1-2 defensible integrations (NetDocs, iManage)
- [ ] Prepare acquisition discussions (Ironclad, DocuSign, Litera)
- [ ] Plan for Series A OR acquisition exit

## 📋 CONFIDENCE LEVELS

| Claim | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Market opportunity ($5.2B+ TAM) | 90% | Gartner, Technavio, McKinsey data |
| Legal sales cycles 4-8 months | 85% | Legal Tech Management, Deloitte, Bloomberg Law |
| Law firm data privacy concerns | 90% | 79% lawyers avoid AI; Deloitte compliance study |
| Deployment 8-12 weeks realistic | 85% | Kira Systems precedent, competitor analysis |
| Ironclad will move downmarket | 70% | Pricing data, market pressure signals |
| LTV:CAC 3-5:1 achievable | 80% | Unit economics math checks out |

## ⚠️ BIGGEST UNKNOWNS

1. **Data privacy adoption:** Will law firms really trust uploading live client data? (Need pilot validation)
2. **AI accuracy in wild:** Will 85-90% accuracy be acceptable in practice? (Need customer feedback)
3. **Competitive timeline:** When will Ironclad move downmarket? (Estimate: Q2-Q4 2026)
4. **Churn rate:** Will law firms churn at 15-20% or 30-40%? (Depends on value delivery)
5. **Founder sustainability:** Can you do 50/50 sales + product for 18 months without burning out? (Personal question)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

**The original GTM plan is optimistic across every dimension.**
- Sales cycles 2-4 months → actually 4-8 months
- Customers 3-5 by M12 → actually 2-3 
- Deployment 2-4 weeks → actually 8-12 weeks
- ARR $75K by M12 → actually $40-60K

**This doesn't mean REJECT.** It means:
1. Reset expectations downward
2. Plan for 18-24 months to $150K ARR (not 12 months)
3. Validate critical assumptions before building
4. View business as acquisition exit (not infinite business)
5. Prepare for Ironclad competition in year 2

**Bottom line:** Opportunity is real, but execution is harder. Proceed with validated assumptions, not optimistic claims.

---

**Score:** 72/100 ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS**  
**Recommendation:** Proceed with validation phase; do not proceed directly to building without 3-month validation sprint
