## ⚡ TL;DR: The Pitch

### Problem
Privacy Officers at SMBs spend 20-25 hours/week on manual compliance work:
- Gathering audit evidence (scattered across 5+ tools)
- Tracking Data Subject Requests (spreadsheet nightmare)
- Preparing for regulatory audits (6+ weeks of rework)
- Managing team approvals (no visibility or audit trail)

**Cost:** $85K-$122K/year per company + regulatory risk

### Solution
**PrivacyFlow** = One dashboard for all compliance needs

**Core features (MVP):**
1. Compliance checklist (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA templates)
2. Evidence dashboard (link Google Drive, Slack, Jira docs)
3. DSR workflow (intake → route → deadline tracking → proof)
4. Audit report (one-click PDF export)
5. + Integrations, role-based workflows, mobile logger

**Time to audit-ready:** 6 weeks → 2 weeks

### Market
- **TAM:** 15K SMBs in US/EU needing compliance tools
- **ICP:** Privacy Officers @ 50-300 person tech/healthcare/finance companies
- **ACV:** $10.5K/year
- **GTM:** Founder-led sales (Privacy Officer network)

### Economics
- **Year 1:** 25 customers × $10.5K = $262.5K ARR
- **LTV:CAC:** 63.5:1 (exceptional)
- **Payback:** 0.6 months (excellent)
- **Profitability:** Month 9-12 with 15-20 customers

### Timeline
- **Months 1-3:** MVP build (7 features, 3-month solo/duo founder timeline)
- **Month 3:** Beta launch with 3-5 design partners
- **Months 4-6:** Founder-led sales (25 customer target)
- **Month 7+:** Scale with Phase 2 GTM (content, partners, hiring)

## 🚀 Sales Motion (Founder-Led, 6 Months)

### Prospecting
- **Target:** Privacy Officers @ tech/healthcare/finance companies
- **Channels:** LinkedIn, IAPP groups, Legal Tech communities, Privacy conferences
- **Volume:** 200 leads → 40 calls → 25 demos → 25 closes

### Discovery Call (15 min)
1. Current audit process? (understand pain)
2. How many hours/week? (quantify)
3. Who else approves? (buying committee)
4. When do you need to solve? (urgency)
5. Schedule demo (if strong fit)

### Demo (30 min)
1. Recap their pain (2 min)
2. Show audit checklist loaded with their framework (5 min)
3. Walk DSR workflow (5 min)
4. Evidence dashboard + integrations (5 min)
5. ROI calculation (3 min)
6. Trial signup (2 min)
7. Next steps (3 min)

### Common Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| OneTrust too expensive | OneTrust = $50K-200K; PrivacyFlow = $12K. We focus on SMBs, they focus on enterprise. |
| Spreadsheets work fine | Auditors want audit trails + role-based approvals + immutable logs. Spreadsheets don't prove compliance. |
| Not urgent now | When audit notice arrives (30-60 days), you'll need to move fast. Let's get you ready now. |
| Need IT approval | Smart. IT usually worries about security + audit logs. We have both. Let's schedule a tech call. |

## 📈 Unit Economics (Quick Math)

**Revenue per customer:**
- ACV: $10.5K/year
- Expansion: +18%/year (seat growth + tier upgrades)
- Churn: -30%/year (Privacy Officers change roles; but high expansion means +8% net)

**Cost per customer:**
- CAC: $530 (founder time valued at $100/hr)
- Service delivery: ~$200 (onboarding)
- Annual support: ~$300 (hosting, email)

**Lifetime value:**
- LTV: $33,660 (10.5K × 3.2 year lifetime)
- LTV:CAC: 63.5:1 (exceptional, target ≥3:1)
- Payback: 0.6 months (break even in ~2 weeks)

**Profitability:**
- Year 1: 25 customers × $10.5K - $150K (founder + engineer) = **-$87.5K** (loss, expected)
- Year 2: 120 customers × $12K - $350K (team scale) = **+$1.09M** (profit!)
- Year 3: 400 customers × $13.5K - $800K (team scale) = **+$5.4M** (strong)

## ✅ Validation Checklist (Before MVP Build)

Before committing to 3-month build, validate 5 key assumptions with 10 Privacy Officer interviews:

- [ ] They spend 15-25 hours/week on audit prep + DSR (primary pain)
- [ ] They would pay $10-15K/year for solution (price sensitivity)
- [ ] Audit prep (not DSR or vendor risk) is #1 priority (feature prioritization)
- [ ] They can self-serve setup in <30 min, no IT needed (GTM feasibility)
- [ ] Their IT director approves cloud tools without lengthy evaluation (buying process)

**Proceed if:** 7+/10 interviews affirm all 5 assumptions
**Pivot if:** <7/10 affirm (consider Option B or C)

1. Pain: "How do you currently handle audit prep and DSRs?"
2. Quantify: "How many hours per week does this take?"
3. Urgency: "When's your next audit scheduled?"
4. Buying: "Who else would need to approve a compliance tool?"
5. Price: "What's your budget for compliance tech?"

**Goal:** 7+/10 affirm all 5 assumptions → green light for MVP build
**If <7/10:** Reassess priorities, consider pivot to Option B or C
