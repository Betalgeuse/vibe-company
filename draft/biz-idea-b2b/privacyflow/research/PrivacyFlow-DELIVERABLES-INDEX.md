## Validation Checklist

### Required to proceed with MVP build:

- [ ] Validate ICP with 10 discovery calls (target: 7/10 affirm primary pain)
- [ ] Confirm Privacy Officer would pay $10-15K/year (price sensitivity check)
- [ ] Verify audit prep is #1 priority (feature prioritization)
- [ ] Test self-serve onboarding (< 30 min assumption)
- [ ] Check IT director approvals (buying process friction)

---

## Key Insights

1. **Market Fit:** Clear, proven pain point (20+ hours/week manual work) worth $85K-$122K/year to target customer

2. **Founder Advantage:** Founder's privacy/compliance background = immediate credibility in market; founder-led sales is most effective GTM for B2B compliance tools

3. **MVP Scope:** 7 core features (audit prep, DSR, evidence, reports, integrations, workflows, mobile) solves 80% of pain in 12 weeks; enterprise features added in Year 2

4. **Unit Economics:** Exceptional LTV:CAC (63.5:1) and rapid payback (0.6 months) means founder can profitably acquire customers and reach cash flow positive by Month 9-12

5. **Scalability:** MVP architecture supports multi-tenancy, audit logging, encryption, and SOC2 path from Day 1; easily scales from 5 customers to 500+ without major refactoring

6. **GTM Clarity:** Founder-led sales model with specific 12-week plan to reach 25 customers; Phase 2 (Month 7-18) scales with content, partnerships, and hiring first AE

## Next Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Validate 5 key assumptions** via 10 discovery calls with Privacy Officers
2. **Design Figma prototype** of core MVP (dashboard, checklist, DSR form)
3. **Competitive deep-dive** on OneTrust, Securiti, TrustArc pricing/features
4. **Technical feasibility** check: PostgreSQL schema for audit logs, multi-tenancy
5. **Search for design partners** (3-5 early adopters for beta, offer free Year 1)

If validation succeeds (7+/10 on key assumptions), proceed to MVP build immediately.
