# DeliverySync GTM Strategy - Executive Summary

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Verdict:** ✅ **CONDITIONAL PASS** (Score: 7.5/10)

---

## TL;DR: Can DeliverySync Reach $150K ARR with a Strong GTM?

**Yes**, but execution is critical. Here's the path:

| Timeline | Model | ARR | Customers | Founder Effort |
|----------|-------|-----|-----------|---|
| **Month 3** | Founder-Led | $12K | 1 | 25 hrs/wk |
| **Month 6** | Founder-Led | $72K | 6 | 25 hrs/wk |
| **Month 9** | Hybrid | $120K | 10 | 15-20 hrs/wk |
| **Month 12** | Hybrid | $150K+ | 12-15 | 10-15 hrs/wk |

**Key Insight:** First customer takes 10 weeks. After that, if trial-to-paid is 60%+, momentum accelerates.

## The Winning GTM: Hybrid Founder-Led + Outbound

### Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Founder-Led Sales
- **Model:** Founder does 25-30 hrs/week of sales (outreach + discovery + demos)
- **Target:** 5-8 customers, $60-100K ARR
- **Channels:** 70% outbound (LinkedIn/email), 30% inbound/referrals
- **Key Metric:** 15-20% conversion from discovery call to paid customer

### Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Hybrid (Founder + First Sales Person)
- **Model:** Hire BDR/SDR in Month 3-4. Founder mentors, takes enterprise deals only.
- **Target:** 12-15 customers cumulative, $150K+ ARR
- **Channels:** 50% outbound, 30% inbound, 20% partnerships
- **Key Metric:** First sales person generating 30-40% of pipeline by Month 12

### Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Scalable Self-Serve + Sales
- **Model:** Sales team handles 80% of customer closes. Inbound matures.
- **Target:** $250K-400K ARR
- **Channels:** 40% outbound, 35% inbound, 20% partnerships, 5% paid ads (testing)

## Channel Priority (Ranking by CAC + Viability)

| # | Channel | CAC | Timeline | Effort | Recommendation |
|---|---------|-----|----------|--------|--|
| **1** | Outbound (LinkedIn/Email) | $2.5K | 8-12 wks | HIGH | ⭐⭐⭐ START IMMEDIATELY |
| **2** | Inbound (SEO/Content) | $5K | 6-12 mo | MEDIUM | ⭐⭐ START MONTH 1 |
| **3** | Partnerships/Referrals | $1K | 6-12 mo | MEDIUM | ⭐⭐ START MONTH 3-4 |
| **4** | Paid Ads | $8K | N/A | MEDIUM | ❌ YEAR 2+ ONLY |

**Why Outbound First:** Fastest path to first revenue (8-12 weeks). Founder can execute immediately. Proven model for $12-25K ACV.

---

## Sales Process (8-12 Week Cycle)

```
Week 1-2: Prospecting (LinkedIn/Email to 50+ prospects)
         ↓
Week 3-4: Discovery Calls (30 min each, qualify fit)
         ↓
Week 5-6: Demos (45-60 min, tailored to pain point)
         ↓
Week 7-8: Trial (30-day free access, measure "aha moment" by day 20)
         ↓
Week 9-10: Trial Wrap-up & Negotiation
         ↓
Week 11-12: Close & Implementation
```

**Conversion Rates by Stage:**
- Discovery → Demo: 60%
- Demo → Trial: 70%
- Trial → Paid: 50-60% (critical!)
- **Overall:** 15-20% (discovery to paid customer)

---

## Critical Success Factors (Do These, Win. Skip These, Fail.)

### 1. **Founder Availability: 25+ Hours/Week (Months 1-6)**
- **Why:** First customer is product-market fit validation. Only founder has credibility.
- **Risk:** If founder can't do this, GTM fails immediately.
- **Mitigation:** If unavailable, hire interim sales consultant or advisor.

### 2. **ICP Precision: 40%+ Outreach to True VP Operations/Ops Director**
- **Why:** Wrong ICP kills CAC (burns through prospects).
- **Action:** Build ZoomInfo/Apollo list of 500 targeted firms. Validate fit before campaign.
- **Flag:** If response rate <8%, ICP is wrong. Pause and recalibrate.

### 3. **Trial-to-Paid Conversion: 60%+**
- **Why:** Makes or breaks sales velocity. If <40%, cycle extends to 12+ weeks.
- **Action:** Day 15 check-in call. Day 20 "aha moment" measurement (50+ hours logged).
- **Flag:** If <50%, product/onboarding needs work before scaling.

### 4. **Sales Cycle Discipline: 70%+ Close Within 8 Weeks**
- **Why:** Long cycles = high founder effort per deal. Need velocity.
- **Action:** Track cycle length weekly. Escalate trials >60 days.
- **Flag:** If average >70 days, objection handling or product clarity issue.

### 5. **Referral Loop by Month 6: 20%+ of New Opportunities**
- **Why:** Enables transition to Phase 2. Reduces CAC.
- **Action:** Collect customer testimonials. Build case studies. Referral program ($500 credit).
- **Flag:** If <10% referrals by month 6, customer satisfaction issue.

## Top 3 GTM Risks (Ranked by Severity)

### 🔴 **Risk #1: Trial Drop-off (Trial-to-Paid <50%)**
- **Impact:** Sales cycle extends to 12+ weeks. CAC explodes. Revenue stalls.
- **Probability:** 60% (PSA onboarding is complex)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Day 1 onboarding call (dedicated CS)
  - Day 15 mandatory check-in
  - Feature gate: Core value only by day 20
  - Call churned trials within 48 hours

### 🟠 **Risk #2: Competitive Displacement (Lose to Kantata/Float)**
- **Impact:** Founder spends 8 weeks in sales, loses in final week to incumbent.
- **Probability:** 70% (very competitive PSA market)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Position as "Kantata Alternative" (same features, 40% cheaper)
  - Offer free data migration (removes #1 switching barrier)
  - Pick 1 niche (agencies/consulting/remote) and dominate
  - Build word-of-mouth + referral culture

### 🟠 **Risk #3: Founder Burnout (25-30 hrs/week for 6+ months)**
- **Impact:** By month 4-5, founder exhausted. Demos slow. Sales stall.
- **Probability:** 50% (common early-stage problem)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Hire BDR/SDR early (Month 3-4, not Month 6+)
  - Document sales process (Month 1-2)
  - Batch demo days (2x/week for 4-5 demos at once)
  - Weekly metrics + sustainability check-in

## Recommended GTM Model: Founder-Led Sales + Outbound (Score: 8.2/10)

**Not PLG.** Not fully sales-assisted yet. **Founder-led sales** is the path.

### Why This Works:
1. ✅ Founder credibility matters in early-stage PSA market
2. ✅ Allows rapid product feedback loop
3. ✅ Market-standard for $12-25K ACV B2B SaaS
4. ✅ Validates product-market fit before scaling
5. ✅ CAC is very healthy ($2.5-4.5K)

### Timeline to $150K ARR:
- **Month 1-3:** First customer (10 weeks sales cycle)
- **Month 4-6:** Scale to 6 customers ($72K ARR)
- **Month 7-9:** Hybrid model (hire BDR), scale to 10 customers
- **Month 10-12:** 12-15 customers, **$150K+ ARR** ✅

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Validate Product-Market Fit** (First 3 customers)
   - Measure: Trial-to-paid conversion rate (target: 60%+)
   - If <50%: Pause outbound. Fix product first.

2. **Build ICP List & Start Outbound** (Week 1)
   - 500-person target list (ZoomInfo/Apollo)
   - 3 outreach templates ready
   - Landing page + free trial live

3. **Measure & Iterate** (Ongoing)
   - Track CAC, conversion rates, sales cycle
   - Adjust ICP if response rate <8%
   - Escalate trials >60 days

4. **Hire First BDR/SDR** (Month 3-4)
   - Before founder burns out
   - Document sales playbook first
   - Target: 40% of pipeline from BDR by Month 12

5. **Launch Referral Program & Content** (Month 3)
   - Customer testimonials + case studies
   - Blog posts on PSA, time tracking, ROI
   - Referral credit program ($500/customer)

---

## Final Verdict

**✅ CONDITIONAL PASS: GTM is viable. $150K ARR in 12 months is achievable.**

**But execution is critical.**

Success depends on:
1. Founder's commitment (25-30 hrs/week, 6+ months)
2. ICP precision (targeting the right VP Operations)
3. Trial-to-paid conversion (60%+ required)
4. Early hiring (BDR by Month 3-4)
5. Sales process discipline (70%+ close within 8 weeks)

If founder executes on these 5 factors, **70%+ probability of success.**
