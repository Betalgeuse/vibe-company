## 4. GTM Strategy (21/30)

### Recommended Model: Hybrid
1. **Phase 1 (Month 1-3):** Founder-led sales → First 10 design partners
2. **Phase 2 (Month 2-6):** Accountant partnerships → Xero/QBO marketplace
3. **Phase 3 (Month 4+):** Freemium self-serve → Viral loop

### Channel Economics
| Channel | CAC | Scalability |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Founder-led | $20-30K | ❌ Not sustainable |
| Partnerships | $375 | ✅ Primary lever |
| Marketplace | $500-800 | ✅ Secondary |
| Freemium | $1,000 | ⚠️ Long-term |

### 90-Day Playbook
- **Week 1-2:** Finalize MVP, draft partnership pitch
- **Week 3-4:** Outreach to 50 accounting firms
- **Month 2:** Onboard 2-3 partnerships, marketplace prep
- **Month 3:** Launch freemium → **$40-50K ARR target**
