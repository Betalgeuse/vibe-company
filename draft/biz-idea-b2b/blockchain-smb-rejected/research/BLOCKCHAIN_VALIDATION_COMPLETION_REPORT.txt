OPPORTUNITIES ANALYZED
================================================================================

#1: SMART CONTRACT TESTING SAAS
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Score: 82/100 | Verdict: ✅ PASS | Recommendation: GO FIRST
Confidence: 85%

Strengths:
- Best unit economics (LTV:CAC 8-12:1)
- Fastest profitability (Month 3)
- Lowest capital requirement ($20K)
- Proven GTM playbook (developer tools)
- Solo founder viable

Vulnerabilities Found (Round 1):
1. FREE FOUNDRY PARADOX (HIGH) — Why pay $25K if Foundry is free + 10x faster?
2. UNPROVEN UX ADVANTAGE (HIGH) — No evidence you're 5x easier than Foundry
3. SALES CYCLE REALITY (MEDIUM) — Likely 3-4 weeks, not 2-3 weeks
4. CHURN UNKNOWN (MEDIUM) — Assume 8-10%, not 5%
5. FOUNDER SKILL GAP (MEDIUM) — No Solidity expertise mentioned

Defense Status (Round 2):
- 2/5 vulnerabilities defensible (Sales cycle, Churn)
- 3/5 remain undefended (UX advantage, Foundry paradigm shift)
- CRITICAL GAP: Must validate UX advantage in Week 1

Verdict (Round 3):
- Month 3 Go/No-Go: 8+ customers AND CAC ≤$1.8K AND churn <10% AND $6K+ MRR
- Key Assumption: Foundry UX won't match your improvements for 18+ months
- Residual Risk: If Foundry improves UX, ARR ceiling drops to $300K (vs $500K potential)

Next Steps:
1. Schedule 20 customer discovery calls THIS WEEK (Hardhat teams)
2. Run competitive spike: Prove 2-minute tests + identify UX advantages
3. Make GO/NO-GO decision end of Week 2 (15+ customer confirmations needed)

#2: ON-CHAIN ANALYTICS - VERTICAL (YIELD FARMING)
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Score: 71/100 | Verdict: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | Recommendation: VALIDATE FIRST
Confidence: 65%

Strengths:
- Solid unit economics (LTV:CAC 6-10:1)
- Community-driven GTM (less founder sales burden)
- Large market (DeFi analytics)

Vulnerabilities Found (Round 1):
1. MARKET DEMAND UNVALIDATED (CRITICAL) — Is yield farming growing or declining?
2. COMPETITIVE MOAT NONEXISTENT (HIGH) — Why switch from Dune/Glassnode?
3. DATA COSTS + MARGIN SQUEEZE (HIGH) — If costs rise, margins collapse
4. CHANNEL MISMATCH (HIGH) — No clear path to first 20 customers
5. INFRASTRUCTURE UNPREDICTABILITY (MEDIUM) — Variable costs are a risk

Defense Status (Round 2):
- 1/5 vulnerabilities defensible (Data costs partially)
- 4/5 remain undefended
- CRITICAL GAP: Market growth validation is MISSING

Verdict (Round 3):
- Month 3 Go/No-Go: 5+ customers AND market growth confirmed AND data costs <$800/mo
- Key Assumption: Yield farming is a growing market (NOT declining)
- Residual Risk: If market declining, TAM shrinks from $300M to $50M

Next Steps:
1. Research: Is yield farming market growing? (must confirm)
2. Interview: 20 traders/protocols on willingness to pay
3. Validate: Data cost model + GTM channel clarity
4. Decision Point: Week 2-4, before committing capital

---

#3: PROTOCOL INFRASTRUCTURE / L2 / ZK TOOLS
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Score: 62/100 | Verdict: ❌ REJECT | Recommendation: AVOID
Confidence: 95%

Critical Flaws:
- IMPOSSIBLE SLA (99.9% uptime) for solo founder
- FATAL CAPITAL MISMATCH (need $200K; have $50K)
- ENTERPRISE SALES REALITY (12-16 weeks, breaks bootstrap model)
- ENTRENCHED COMPETITOR (The Graph, $2B+ market cap)

Vulnerabilities Found (Round 1):
1. ENTERPRISE SALES CYCLE UNREALISTIC (CRITICAL) — 12-16 weeks, not 4-8 weeks
2. INFRASTRUCTURE UPTIME = UNFUNDABLE (CRITICAL) — Can't deliver SLA solo
3. THE GRAPH MOAT (HIGH) — Why switch from battle-tested, $2B+ incumbent?
4. BOOTSTRAP CAPITAL INSUFFICIENT (HIGH) — Need $150-200K; have $50K
5. TECHNICAL EXECUTION RISK (MEDIUM) — Requires 5+ years DevOps/Rust/Go

Defense Status (Round 2):
- 0/5 vulnerabilities defensible
- UNDEFENDABLE — Fatal flaws cannot be addressed

Verdict (Round 3):
- REJECT IMMEDIATELY — Do not pursue unless exceptional circumstances
- Only reconsider if: $200K capital + DevOps co-founder + pre-signed LOI + insider network
- Even then: Success probability = 30% (vs 85% for #1)

Recommendation: SKIP — Focus on #1 instead

- Sales cycle extends 4-6 weeks (probability: HIGH) → mitigation: freemium + case studies
- CAC higher than modeled (probability: MEDIUM) → mitigation: focus organic channels
- Founder lacks Solidity expertise (probability: MEDIUM) → mitigation: hire co-founder

#2: On-Chain Analytics
- Market is declining (probability: HIGH) → mitigation: expand beyond yield farming
- Dune/Glassnode respond with yield features (probability: HIGH) → mitigation: move faster
- Data costs rise 20%+ (probability: MEDIUM) → mitigation: lock-in long-term contracts
- CAC >$2.5K (probability: MEDIUM) → mitigation: viral/community loops
- Customer churn >10% (probability: HIGH) → mitigation: obsess over product

#3: Protocol Infrastructure
- Cannot deliver 99.9% uptime solo (probability: CRITICAL) → no mitigation
- Enterprise sales >12 weeks (probability: CRITICAL) → no mitigation
- Bootstrap capital insufficient (probability: CRITICAL) → no mitigation
