## ✅ Validation Checklist (Before Committing to Opportunity)

Use this checklist to validate your chosen opportunity before starting MVP development:

### Problem Validation (10 Customer Calls)

- [ ] 80%+ customers confirm they have the stated problem
- [ ] 70%+ say problem is urgent (impacts today, not someday)
- [ ] 60%+ would pay $XX,XXX/year for solution
- [ ] 50%+ have budget allocated or can get approval

### Founder-Market Fit Validation

- [ ] You have 70%+ of required skills (rest can be hired)
- [ ] You have network with 5+ potential customers
- [ ] You're excited about the problem (not just money)
- [ ] Your team (if have one) is aligned

### Technical Feasibility Validation

- [ ] You can build MVP in 12-14 weeks (realistic honest estimate)
- [ ] Core features are proven tech (not research)
- [ ] You have access to required infrastructure/APIs
- [ ] No unknown unknowns; you can spike uncertainties

### Market Validation

- [ ] TAM is >$100M (downside: still huge opportunity)
- [ ] You can acquire first 10 customers in 3-6 months
- [ ] Unit economics work at your planned scale
- [ ] Competitors exist but have gaps you can exploit

## 💡 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Which opportunity should I choose?

**A:** Use this decision tree:

```
1. Do you have 10+ years blockchain infrastructure experience?
   YES → Choose #3 (Protocol Infrastructure)
   
2. Do you have DeFi/trading background?
   YES → Choose #2 (On-Chain Analytics)
   
3. Do you have Solidity expertise?
   YES → Choose #1 (Smart Contract Testing) ✅ BEST
   
4. None of above?
   → #1 is easiest to learn; start there
```

### Q: Can I do multiple opportunities in parallel?

**A:** Not recommended (founder bandwidth issue). Choose one, validate PMF (Month 3), then expand.

### Q: What if customer discovery contradicts the spec?

**A:** Great! Iterate on spec. All 3 are frameworks, not scripture. Adapt to market.

### Q: How much capital do I need?

**A:** 
- **Bootstrapping:** $20-30K runway for 3 months (MVP dev only)
- **Pre-seed:** $200-500K (MVP + team + GTM for 6 months)
- **Seed:** $1-2M (MVP + team + GTM for 12 months + buffer)

All 3 can bootstrap if founder works for sweat equity.

### Q: When should I hire?

**A:**
- **Month 1:** Recruit co-founder or #1 engineer (mission-critical)
- **Month 3-4:** Hire #2 engineer (product scaling)
- **Month 4-5:** Hire customer success person (retention)
- **Month 6:** Hire GTM person (sales or marketing) OR first AE

### Q: What if my ICP doesn't match the spec?

**A:** Adapt! The specs are generic archetypes. If your customer is different, validate with 10 calls to your ICP, then adjust.

### Q: How do I know if I should pivot?

**A:** Use go/no-go gates in Section 16 (Milestones). If Month 3 gate fails, pivot or shutdown.
