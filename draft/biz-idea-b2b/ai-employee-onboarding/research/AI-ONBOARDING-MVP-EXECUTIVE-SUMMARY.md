# AI Employee Onboarding — MVP Executive Summary

**Document Status:** Executive Summary for Approval  
**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Full Specification:** `AI-EMPLOYEE-ONBOARDING-MVP-DESIGN.md` (80 KB, comprehensive)

---

## Quick Take (60 seconds)

**What:** AI-powered employee onboarding platform for SMBs (50-150 employees)

**Why:** SMBs waste 15-20 hours/week on manual onboarding; suffer $600K+/year in failed hire costs; competitors either too expensive (Rippling, $50K) or too basic (BambooHR, no IT)

**How:** AI document intelligence (auto-fills I-9 forms), integrated IT provisioning, compliance automation, conversational chatbot

**Market:** $280-350M addressable (SMBs with 50-150 employees); no AI-first competitor for this segment

**Unit Economics:** 
- ACV: $12-18K/year
- CAC: <$6K (break-even <6 months)
- LTV: >$60K (5:1 LTV:CAC ratio)
- Launch Goal: 10-15 customers by end Year 1 = $150-225K ARR

**Timeline:** 3-month MVP → Public launch Q2 2026

## The Problem (Quantified)

### For VP People at Growing Tech Companies

| Pain | Magnitude | Cost |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Time wasted on manual onboarding admin** | 15-20 hours/week | $175K/year in productivity loss |
| **Failed hires (90-day churn)** | 20% of new hires leave early | $420K/year per 60-hire company |
| **Compliance risk (I-9 audits)** | 2.5% audit probability/year | $10K-28K penalty exposure |
| **Productivity lag** | New hires reach 50% productivity in 6 weeks instead of 3 | $180K/year lost output |
| **No tool consolidation** | HR uses BambooHR, IT uses Okta, docs in Google Drive = chaos | Hours per week on manual coordination |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | - | **$615K-800K per company** |

### Why Existing Solutions Lose

| Competitor | Price | Problem |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Rippling** | $50K/year | Too expensive for Series A SMBs; overkill; 6-week setup |
| **BambooHR** | $8-15K/year | No IT provisioning; requires 3-4 integrations (Zapier); no AI |
| **Click Boarding** | $3-8K/year | Basic checklists only; no document automation, no compliance |
| **Gusto** | $12-20K/year | Payroll-focused; weak HR; zero IT provisioning |
| **Spreadsheets** | Free | Error-prone; no audit trail; compliance nightmare |

---

## The Solution (MVP)

### Core MVP Features (Month 1-3 Launch)

| Feature | Value | Why MVP |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Digital Onboarding Checklist** | Centralized task list (no email chaos) | Delivers 30% of value; simplest to build |
| **Document Collection + Storage** | New hires upload docs; HR approves; audit trail | Addresses compliance + pain point #2 |
| **I-9 Compliance** | 2025-form template; compliance validation | Critical for legal/audit; table stakes |
| **Admin Dashboard** | HR sees all onboarding status in one place | Visibility = control; drives adoption |
| **Email + Slack Integration** | Notifications in tools they use; no new app | Frictionless; drives 80%+ adoption rate |

### Phase 1 AI Features (Month 4-6 Launch)

| Feature | Saves | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **AI Document Intelligence (I-9 Auto-Fill)** | 8+ hours per hire | New hire uploads driver's license → AI reads + pre-fills I-9 form |
| **AI Onboarding Chatbot** | HR team 50% faster | "When does my insurance start?" → AI instantly answers from handbook |
| **Predictive Attrition Scoring** | Intervention before churn | ML flags at-risk new hires; HR does proactive check-in |

### Enterprise-Ready Foundation (Day 1)

- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture (each customer isolated)
- ✅ Role-based access control (HR, Manager, New Hire)
- ✅ Audit logging (100% compliance-ready)
- ✅ API-first (extensible for integrations)
- ✅ Data encryption + security baseline
