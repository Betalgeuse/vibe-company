## 🎯 Key Insights at a Glance

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM:** $2.12B global onboarding SaaS market (growing 20%/year)
- **SAM:** $280-350M SMB-focused segment (North America)
- **SOM (Year 1):** $18-35M ARR (conservative 1-2% market capture)
- **Verdict:** STRONG PASS (18/20 scoring)

### Target ICP
- **Title:** VP People / Chief People Officer
- **Company Size:** 50-150 employees
- **Stage:** Series A-B startup
- **Budget:** $12-18K/year
- **Buying Committee:** 2 people (VP People + CFO)
- **Sales Cycle:** 60-90 days
- **Trigger Events:** Series B funding, high turnover, geographic expansion

### Pain Points (Quantified)
- **Time Wasted:** 15-20 hours/week on manual onboarding = $175K/year
- **Failed Hires:** 20% of new hires leave by 90 days = $420K/year
- **Compliance Risk:** I-9 audits, penalties = $10-50K/year exposure
- **Productivity Loss:** 3-week onboarding ramp = $180K/year
- **TOTAL ANNUAL COST:** $615K-800K per customer
- **POTENTIAL SAVINGS:** $231K/year with AI automation

### Competitive Gaps
1. **AI Document Intelligence** (I-9 auto-fill, 8+ hours saved per hire) — No competitor doing this
2. **Integrated HR+IT Onboarding** (single dashboard vs BambooHR + 4 integrations) — Rippling does it but $50K/year, too expensive
3. **SMB-First Pricing** ($8-12K/year vs Rippling's $50K) — Clear price-performance gap
4. **Compliance Automation** (2025 I-9 form, audit trail, state-specific rules) — No one doing comprehensive solution
5. **New Hire Experience** (mobile-first, AI chatbot, personalized onboarding) — Rippling has UI, but not AI-driven
