## Three MVP Direction Options

### Overview Table

| Option | MVP Focus | Target ICP | ACV | GTM | Technical Lift | Success Probability |

## Selected Approach: **Option A (Audit Prep + DSR)**

### Why Option A Wins

| Criteria | A | B | C |
|----------|---|---|---|
| **Market Size** | 15K SMBs in US/EU | 5K high-volume DSR handlers | 8K premium companies |
| **Founder Sales Feasibility** | ✅ Easy (Privacy Officer pain is obvious) | ⚠️ Medium (needs industry focus) | ❌ Hard (long sales cycle to GC) |
| **MVP Simplicity** | ✅ Moderate (can build 3 months) | ✅ Fast (can ship 6-8 weeks) | ❌ Complex (UI heavy, long build) |
| **Revenue Potential** | ✅ $262.5K Y1 (25 customers × $10.5K) | ⚠️ $210K Y1 (15 customers × $14K) | ✅ $360K Y1 (18 customers × $20K) but harder close |
| **Unit Economics** | ✅ 63:1 LTV:CAC | ✅ 48:1 LTV:CAC | ⚠️ 40:1 (longer CAC) |
| **Founder-Market Fit** | ✅ Founder has privacy background | ⚠️ Requires fintech/healthcare network | ❌ Requires legal tech sales skills |
| **Upmarket Potential** | ✅ Scales to $1M+ ARR with 10-customer cohort | ⚠️ Flattens (DSR-only is niche) | ✅ Scales to $3M+ ARR but slow ramp |

**Verdict:** Option A is **safe, fast, and achievable**. Founder should execute Option A for Year 1, then evaluate Option B (DSR vertical deepening) and Option C (upmarket expansion) for Year 2+.

### GTM Strategy (Founder-Led Sales)

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Founder-led outreach → 25 customers, $262.5K ARR

**Tactics:**
1. **LinkedIn prospecting** - "Privacy Officer" + "Compliance Manager" searches; personalized outreach
2. **Community building** - Join IAPP, Legal Tech Slack groups, Privacy subreddits
3. **Content marketing** - Blog: "GDPR audit checklist", "DSR response template"; LinkedIn newsletter
4. **Network leverage** - Leverage founder's privacy background (recommendations, introductions)
5. **Design partner strategy** - Identify 5 early adopters, offer free Year 1 for feedback + case studies

**Sales playbook:**
- **Discovery call script** (15 min): Current audit process → pain quantification → buying process → timeline
- **Demo script** (30 min): Show their audit checklist pre-loaded, DSR workflow, evidence linking
- **Objection handling:** OneTrust too expensive, spreadsheets work, not urgent, IT needs approval
- **Close rate target:** 40% of trials → paid (25 closes from 60 prospects)

**Sales metrics (Year 1):**
- 200 outbound leads (manual LinkedIn + email)
- 40 discovery calls (20% conversion)
- 25 demos (65% of calls)
- 25 closes (100% of demos, 40% trial-to-paid rate)
- CAC: $530 (founder time + tools)

### Onboarding Flow (Week 1-2 Critical Path)

**Day 1 (< 30 minutes):**
- Sign up + industry selection → checklist auto-loads
- Add 3-4 team members (CEO, Legal, IT, Privacy Officer)
- Link Google Drive folder
- Create first sample DSR, route to IT
- View dashboard (18/47 checklist items complete ✅)

**Week 1:**

- Configure DSR workflows (Privacy Officer + IT)
- Team members log in, accept roles
- Slack reminders activated
- **Outcome:** 30/47 checklist items complete, 5-10 documents linked

**Week 2:**
- Evidence collection sprint → link compliance proof
- Generate first audit report
- Review with General Counsel
- Test DSR workflow with sample request
- **Outcome:** 35/47 checklist items (74%), audit-ready proof, 1 DSR processed

**Success metrics:**
- ✅ Checklist > 70% complete
- ✅ Evidence dashboard > 10 documents
- ✅ ≥ 1 DSR request processed
- ✅ 4/5 team members logged in

**Result:** Customer sees immediate ROI—audit prep cut from 6 weeks to 2 weeks.

### Unit Economics

|-------|--------|
| **Frontend** | React + Next.js 14 |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Redis cache |
| **File Storage** | AWS S3 (encrypted, audit logged) |
| **Auth** | Auth0 or Supabase Auth (OAuth, multi-tenant) |
| **Integrations** | Slack (webhooks), Google (OAuth), Jira (API), Zapier/n8n (outbound) |

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Long sales cycle (60-90 days)** | H | Start outreach Month 1 for Month 3-4 closes; build pipeline |
| **Churn if sticky isn't strong** | H | Week 2 audit-ready → high retention; expand revenue via seat growth |
| **Price resistance** | M | Focus on ROI ($40K/year saved); compare to OneTrust (10x more expensive) |
| **Founder sales skills gap** | M | Take sales course (MEDDIC); or hire VP Sales Month 6 |
| **Integration complexity** | H | Use Zapier/n8n instead of custom dev; pre-built templates |

---

### Why This Works for PrivacyFlow Founder

1. ✅ **Domain expertise:** Founder has privacy/compliance background = instant credibility
2. ✅ **Clear pain:** Privacy Officers spend 20+ hours/week on this today
3. ✅ **Measurable ROI:** Save 8-10 hours/week × $100/hr = $40K/year benefit
4. ✅ **Existing network:** Founder can leverage privacy community (IAPP, conferences)
5. ✅ **Achievable MVP:** 3 months is realistic for audit prep + DSR + evidence
6. ✅ **Unit economics:** 63:1 LTV:CAC means profitable by Month 6-9 with ~15 customers
7. ✅ **Upmarket potential:** Audit prep + DSR is foundation for advanced features (data discovery, vendor risk, consent)

## Why Not Option B (DSR-Only)?

**Pros:**
- Faster build (6-8 weeks vs 3 months)
- Clearer customer pain (DSR compliance is legal mandate)
- Could integrate with specialized platforms (e.g., Didomi for consent management)

**Cons:**
- Narrower market (only companies handling 50+ DSRs/year)
- Product gets commoditized (many DSR tools exist: DPR, Osano)
- Lower founder leverage (requires healthcare/fintech specialization)
- ACV is lower ($12-15K) due to smaller TAM
- Churn risk (once DSR process is set up, customers have low touch)

**Verdict:** Good 2nd product (Year 2), but too risky as MVP. Audit prep is bigger pain.

---

## Why Not Option C (Premium Audit Readiness)?

**Pros:**
- Higher ACV ($15-20K) and upmarket potential
- Could position as "enterprise-grade compliance"
- General Counsel buying power is strong

**Cons:**
- Longer build (4-5 months, UX-heavy)
- Longer sales cycle (90-120 days to GC approval)
- Founder doesn't have GC/enterprise sales background
- Higher CAC ($2K-3K to reach GC vs $530 for Privacy Officer)
- Unit economics suffer (slower close, higher acquisition cost)
- Timing risk: MVP takes too long, competitors ship first

**Verdict:** Good upmarket strategy for Year 2-3, but too risky for MVP.

---

## Recommendation

**Execute Option A immediately:**
1. Week 1: Design onboarding flow + competitive research
2. Week 2: Build Figma prototype
3. Weeks 3-8: MVP development (auth, dashboard, DSR, evidence, integrations)
4. Weeks 9-11: Testing, design partner onboarding, Sales readiness
5. Week 12: Launch with 3-5 customers, $0 ARR → $35K ARR (first 3 closes within 2 weeks of launch)

**Timeline to profitability:**
- 25 customers by Month 6 = $262.5K ARR
- 50 customers by Month 12 = $525K ARR
- 100 customers by Month 18 = $1.05M ARR

**By Month 9, founder should have:**
- 15-20 paying customers
- 3 strong case studies
- Positive unit economics (LTV > 3x CAC)
- Clear evidence of product-market fit (>15% MoM growth)

## Key Assumptions to Validate

Before full build, run 10 discovery calls with Privacy Officers to validate:

1. ☐ They spend 15-25 hours/week on audit prep + DSR (assumed pain)
2. ☐ They would pay $10-15K/year for solution (price sensitivity)
3. ☐ Audit prep (not DSR or vendor risk) is #1 priority (feature prioritization)
4. ☐ They can self-serve setup (<30 min, no IT needed) (GTM feasibility)
5. ☐ Their IT director approves cloud tools without lengthy evaluation (buying process)

If 7+/10 validate all 5, proceed to MVP build. If <7/10, pivot to Option B or C.
