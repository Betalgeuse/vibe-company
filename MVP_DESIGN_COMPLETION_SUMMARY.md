## 🏆 RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

### Primary Focus: ComplianceRunner (Opportunity A)
**Conviction**: 94%  
**Allocation**: 70% of team effort (months 1-6)  

**Why**:
1. **Superior Unit Economics**: 8.2:1 LTV:CAC vs 5.2:1 (58% better)
2. **Larger TAM**: $1.5B vs $200-300M (7.5x larger)
3. **Shorter Sales Cycle**: 30-60 days vs 60-90 days (faster to revenue)
4. **Stronger Moat**: AI control generation + integrations (harder to copy)
5. **Enterprise Upside**: Path to $2-5K/mo deals as customers scale
6. **Expansion Path**: GDPR, ISO27001, HIPAA = $300-400/mo additions
7. **GTM Winner**: Market research confirmed it as GTM winner (21/30 score)

**6-Month Outcome**: 25-30 customers, $28-35K MRR, $336K+ ARR run rate

### Secondary Validation: CashLens (Opportunity B)
**Conviction**: 82%  
**Allocation**: 30% of team effort (months 3-4 for validation)  

**Why as Backup**:
1. **Perfect Founder-Market Fit**: Finance expert on team = 9.5/10 fit
2. **Lower Execution Risk**: Simpler integrations, self-serve motion
3. **Real Pain**: 80% of founders manage cash in Excel
4. **Defensive**: If Compliance stalls, CashLens is validation fallback
5. **Strong Economics**: Still 5.2:1 LTV:CAC and 3.2mo payback

**Risk**: Stripe/Brex could add native forecasting, destroying TAM  
**Mitigation**: Move upmarket faster, expand to board prep and investor updates

**6-Month Outcome (if validated)**: 20-30 customers, $12-18K MRR, $144K+ ARR run rate

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### ComplianceRunner Must-Haves
1. **Week 2-3**: Validate with Big4 auditor (Deloitte, EY, KPMG)
   - Goal: Confirm our generated reports are audit-ready
   - Risk: If fails → pivot quickly

2. **Week 4-5**: Get 3 beta customers + case studies
   - Goal: Prove AI controls actually work in real deployments
   - Risk: If features don't land, iterate before launch

3. **Month 1**: Founder domain expertise building
   - Goal: Learn compliance deeply (take 1-2 courses, SANS material)
   - Risk: If founder uninterested → won't sell effectively

4. **Month 2**: Sales hiring decision
   - Goal: Decide between founder-led vs hiring first AE/SDR
   - Risk: Scaling founder-led sales beyond 10-15 deals is hard

### CashLens Must-Haves
1. **Week 4-5**: Forecast accuracy validation
   - Goal: Prove forecast error <10% for 90-day window
   - Risk: If accuracy poor → customer churn inevitable

2. **Week 3-4**: Stripe/Brex partnership outreach
   - Goal: Secure co-marketing or integration partnership
   - Risk: If partnership unavailable → validation slower

3. **Month 1**: 20 founder discovery calls
   - Goal: Confirm cash forecasting is top-5 pain, validate WTP
   - Risk: If pain is #10 pain → pivot or abandon

4. **Month 3**: Content marketing engine up
   - Goal: Blog + Twitter building audience for organic growth
   - Risk: If content doesn't rank → paid CAC needed

## 📅 DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Month 4 Go/No-Go Decision Point

**ComplianceRunner Outcomes:**
- ✅ **10+ customers, $8-10K MRR** → SCALE (hire SDR/AE)
- ⚠️ **5-8 customers, $4-6K MRR** → OPTIMIZE (improve GTM)
- ❌ **<5 customers, <$3K MRR** → PIVOT (consider CashLens)

**CashLens Validation Results (parallel track):**
- ✅ **10+ prospects expressing strong demand** → Upgrade to primary
- ⚠️ **5-10 prospects interested** → Continue as secondary
- ❌ **<5 prospects interested** → Archive, explore Opportunity C

**Combined Outcome Decision:**
- Both strong → Run both (scale team)
- A strong, B weak → Maximize A
- B strong, A weak → Switch to B
- Both weak → Pause, iterate, restart with new hypothesis
