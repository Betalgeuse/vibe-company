### Compliance Automation for SMB Tech (SOC2/GDPR)

| Dimension | Details |
|---|---|
| **Target ICP** | CTOs/COOs at 15-100 person funded SaaS |
| **Pain Point** | SOC2 audit cost $50-150K; no system to manage compliance |
| **Product** | AI-generated SOC2 controls → Evidence collection → Audit-ready reports |
| **ACV** | $13.5K (blended: $499-1,299/mo) |
| **Sales Cycle** | 30-60 days (compliance = urgent) |
| **CAC** | $2,000 (founder-led year 1) |
| **LTV:CAC** | **8.2:1** ✅ |
| **Payback** | **2.2 months** ✅ |
| **NRR** | 125% (expansion revenue strong) |
| **TAM** | $1.5B+ |
| **6-Month Target** | 25-30 customers, $28-35K MRR |
| **Viability** | **9.2/10** (GTM winner) |

### MVP Features (8 weeks)
1. **AI Control Generator** (2.5w): Auto-generate 25 SOC2 controls from tech stack
