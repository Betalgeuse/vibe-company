## 🎯 Success Criteria & Verification

### For "CONDITIONAL PASS" Verdict to Remain Valid:

✅ **Must validate within 3 months:**
1. Trial-to-paid conversion ≥60% (Critical)
2. Discovery-to-demo conversion ≥60%
3. CAC ≤$5K (Actual)
4. Sales cycle 45-60 days
5. Demo-to-trial conversion ≥70%

⚠️ **If any of these fail:**
- Trial-to-paid <50% → Product/onboarding issue (pause outbound)
- Discovery-to-demo <50% → ICP wrong (adjust targeting)
- CAC >$6K → Channel wrong or conversion low
- Sales cycle >70 days → Price or feature gap issue
