## 🚨 Critical Risks

### Red Flags (Monitor Closely)

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Free-to-paid drops to <6%** | 🔴 HIGH | Poor onboarding, aha moment misses |
| **CAC increases to >$2K** | 🔴 HIGH | Sales cycle lengthens, market competition |
| **Churn spikes to 5%+** | 🔴 HIGH | Product bugs, competitor launches, feature gaps |
| **ACV drops to $3.2K** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Pricing competition, customer mix shifts |

### Validations Required (MVP Phase)

1. **Free-to-Paid Conversion**: Target 6-8% (plan for less than 12%)
2. **CAC Timing**: Can founder close first customer in <3 months?
3. **Churn Stability**: Is compliance truly sticky? Monitor 90-day retention
4. **NRR Reality**: Do 20%+ of customers upgrade to Pro or add seats?

## 💰 Business Viability Assessment

### Year 1 Projections (Base Case)

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------|------------|
| Customers (YE) | 30 | 50 | 70 |
| ARR | $135K | $225K | $390K |
| Gross Profit | $101K | $169K | $304K |
| LTV:CAC | 10:1 | 10:1 | 33.9:1 |
| Payback Period | 3.8 mo | 3.3 mo | 1.5 mo |

### Viability Threshold: ✅ **PASS**

- **ARR $150K+ achievable**: Base case = $225K ✓
- **Favorable unit economics**: Even pessimistic case (LTV:CAC 2.66:1) marginal but salvageable
- **Clear path to $1M+ ARR**: Scale CAC efficiency (organic grows), expand product (API), improve NRR

## 🎬 Immediate Action Items

### MVP Phase (Months 1-3)
- [ ] Track activation metrics daily: % who screen first customer in <24h
- [ ] Measure actual CAC (not projected): close first 5 customers, calculate real spend
- [ ] Monitor churn from Day 1: any early churn = investigate immediately
- [ ] Plan for 6-8% free-to-paid conversion, treat 12%+ as upside

### GTM Phase (Months 3-6)
- [ ] A/B test free tier limits (10 vs 25 vs 50 screens)
- [ ] Launch content marketing: blog posts targeting "export compliance" keywords
- [ ] Build case studies from first 5 customers: quantify ROI
- [ ] Measure expansion revenue explicitly: % of customers upgrading/expanding

### Scale Phase (Months 7-12)
- [ ] Hire SDR if CAC payback validated (<4 months)
- [ ] Test paid search if organic working (CAC <$800)
- [ ] Build API for Pro tier: unlock $5K+ ACV path
- [ ] Report unit economics monthly: dashboard tracking CAC, LTV, NRR, Magic Number

## ✅ Final Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH MVP** — Unit economics support business case, but **validate key assumptions in beta**:

1. **Free-to-paid conversion** (target 6-8%, upside 12%)
2. **CAC realization** (target $1.25K founder-led, $800 by month 7)
3. **Churn stability** (target 2-3% monthly, watch for 5%+)
4. **NRR execution** (target 105% conservatively, strive for 115%)
