# LegalAI - One-Page Executive Summary

## The Opportunity
**Problem**: Law firms (50-250 emp) waste 30-40% of junior paralegal time ($30-50K/year) on repetitive contract review.

**Solution**: AI-powered document review platform that automates 70-80% of this work in 1 day for $20K/year.

**Why It Works**: 
- Luminance charges $100K+ and takes 6+ months to implement (enterprise-only)
- LegalAI is 5x cheaper, deploys in 1 day, built for SMBs
- Clear $30-50K ROI per firm → 8.5:1 LTV:CAC ratio

## The Numbers (Year 1-3)
| Metric | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| **Customers** | 20 | 40 | 75 |
| **ARR** | $400K | $880K | $1.8M |
| **Gross Margin** | 65% | 80% | 85% |
| **CAC** | $10K | $8K | $6K |

| **LTV:CAC** | **8.5:1** | **15:1** | **26:1** |
| **Payback** | 9 mo | 7 mo | 4 mo |

**Verdict**: Healthy unit economics, strong payback, scalable to $1.8M ARR by Year 3.

## MVP (12 Weeks)
**Must-Have Features**:
- Document upload (drag-drop PDF/DOCX)
- AI clause extraction + risk flagging (GPT-4)
- Dashboard (view results)
- Export (PDF, CSV)
- Basic user management

**Out of Scope**: Integrations (NetDocs/iManage), advanced redline, mobile, multi-language

**Tech Stack**: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + GPT-4 API
**Cost**: ~$470/month infrastructure (scales automatically)
**Timeline**: Week 1-3 architecture, Week 4-6 core features, Week 7-9 dashboard, Week 10-12 beta launch

---

## Go-to-Market (Year 1)
**Model**: Founder-led sales → 30 cold outreach/week

**Sales Playbook**:
1. **Discovery Call** (20 min): "How long does review take? What's your pain?"
2. **Demo** (25 min): Show AI in action, calculate ROI
3. **Pilot** (2 weeks): Free trial, 50 contracts, measure time saved
4. **Close** (2-4 weeks): $20K annual contract

**Targets**:
- Month 4: First paying customer
- Month 6: 10 customers, $200K ARR
- Month 12: 20 customers, $400K ARR

**CAC**: $10K per customer (founder time + paid ads) → Breaks even in 9 months ✅

## Competitive Position
| Competitor | Price | Time-to-Deploy | Why We Win |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Luminance** | $100K+ | 6+ months | 5x cheaper, 180x faster |
| **Ironclad** | $50K+ | 3-6 months | No integration required, simpler UX |
| **LawGeex** | $75K+ | 3-4 months | 4x cheaper, plug-and-play |
| **Manual** | $0 (hidden $30-50K) | 0% savings | 70% time savings, cost-positive |

**Moat**: SMB market underserved by enterprise competitors. By Year 2, we have 40 customers + case studies + word-of-mouth.

---

## Risk Assessment (Top 3)
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Long sales cycle** (60-90 days) | 2-week pilot program compresses to 3-4 weeks |
| **AI accuracy concerns** | Explainability (show why flagged); human QA process |
| **Founder burnout** | Hire sales AE at Month 7; delegate |

**Kill Signals**: If CAC >$15K by Month 6, churn >20%/month, or NPS <30, serious pivot needed.

---

## Validation Roadmap (Before Building)
**Week 1-4**: 10 discovery calls with law firm partners
- Success: >50% say problem is "major pain"
- Success: >50% say "$15-30K is reasonable price"
- Go/No-Go decision based on findings

**Month 1-3**: Build MVP, get 3 beta customers
- Success: NPS >40, time-to-value <4 hours
- Success: 100% convert to paying customer

**Month 4-6**: Scale to 10 customers
- Success: <$10K CAC, <15% churn, strong case study

---

## Who This Works For
✅ **Right Fit**:
- Founder who is comfortable doing 30 sales calls/week
- Technical ability to build MVP (or hire to do so)
- 10+ warm law firm intros (or comfort with cold outreach)
- 12 months of runway

❌ **Wrong Fit**:
- Founder who dislikes sales
- No law firm network (cold outreach will be slow)
- Only 3-6 months of runway
- Requires perfect product before launch

---

## Next 7 Days Checklist
- [ ] Schedule 10 discovery calls (LinkedIn, referrals, forums)
- [ ] Ask about: pain severity, review time, pricing sensitivity
- [ ] Sign up for Luminance demo (understand competitive threat)
- [ ] Build 1-page ROI calculator
- [ ] Calculate Go/No-Go score
- [ ] Make build/pivot decision

**By end of Week 4**: Decision made + validation complete OR pivot identified.
