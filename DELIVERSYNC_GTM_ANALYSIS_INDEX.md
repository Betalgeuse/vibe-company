## ✅ Final Verdict

### **CONDITIONAL PASS: GTM is viable. $150K ARR in 12 months is achievable.**

### Why It Works:
1. ✅ Clear buyer with budget authority (VP Operations)
2. ✅ Viable GTM model (founder-led sales)
3. ✅ Strong channels (outbound + inbound)
4. ✅ Realistic revenue path (1 customer → 3 → 6 → 12+)
5. ✅ Healthy unit economics (CAC $2.5-4.5K, LTV $45K)

### Why It's Conditional:
1. ⚠️ Founder availability critical (25+ hrs/week for 6+ months)
2. ⚠️ Trial-to-paid conversion must be 60%+ (product-market fit)
3. ⚠️ ICP targeting must be precise (targeting risk)
4. ⚠️ Competitive intensity high (Kantata, Float, Monday.com)
5. ⚠️ First customer takes 10 weeks (patience required)

### Success Probability:
- **If founder executes on critical success factors: 70%+**
- **If GTM team is hired by Month 6: 80%+**
- **If trial-to-paid <50%: GTM fails (product issue)**
