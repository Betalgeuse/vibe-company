  recommended_model: "Founder-Led Sales (Primary) + Advisor Referral Network (Secondary) - High-touch, trust-driven model for complex B2B financial services"
  
  model_scores:
    product_led_sales: "2/10 - Domain complexity (compliance, broker APIs, regulatory requirements) makes self-serve impossible. 5-7 stakeholder buying committee requires human trust-building. $25-50K ACV too high for PLG. Freemium cannibalization risk in financial services. POOR FIT."
    founder_led_sales: "8/10 - Excellent fit. Founder domain credibility essential for hedge fund decision-makers. 9-12 month sales cycle economically justifies high-touch founder engagement. Implementation complexity (broker integration, compliance sign-off) requires founder involvement. 10 hrs/week sustainable. OPTIMAL MODEL."
    self_serve_plus: "4/10 - Weak fit for MVP stage. Regulatory/broker integration cannot be fully self-serve. Implementation requires 2-4 weeks of hands-on work. Only viable as secondary model in Year 2+ after product standardization. Premature optimization."

  risk_mitigation:
    - risk: "Long Sales Cycle (9-12 months delays revenue)"
      impact: "Cash burn accelerates, revenue doesn't come until Month 9+, jeopardizes runway if funding is insufficient"
      severity: "HIGH"
      mitigation: |
        1. Pilot/POC Program ($0 or $5K discount) - Prove value in 4 weeks, not 9 months
        2. Implementation Fees ($5-10K) - Charge setup fees during contract negotiation for early cash
        3. Advisory Services ($10-20K) - Offer Compliance Strategy consulting while main contract negotiates
        4. Expected impact: $0-15K revenue Months 1-6, $30-60K Months 7-12 (vs $0 base case)
    
    - risk: "High Implementation Cost ($15-50K per customer) compresses margins"
      impact: "Negative gross margin Year 1, NRR < 100%, reduces unit economics viability"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: |
        1. Standardize Implementation (80% automation) - Build playbooks for top 5 brokers (IB, Schwab, CenterPoint, Equinix)
           Timeline: During MVP development, refine with first 2-3 customers
           Target: Reduce from 200 hrs → 50 hrs per customer, saving $30-35K per implementation
        2. Partner Implementation - Outsource to fund admin firms (Alter Domus, Equifax)
           Revenue share: 20-30% of first-year ACV, offload founder burden
        3. Implementation Toolkit - Create self-service guides, videos for 80% of integration
           Target: 150 hrs → 50 hrs per customer handholding
        4. Expected impact: Baseline $40-50K cost → $10-15K cost (30% of ACV) by Customer 5
    
    - risk: "Regulatory Approval Delays (8-12 weeks) extend sales cycle beyond 12 months"
      impact: "First customer close pushed from Month 9 to Month 18, threatens Year 1 targets"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: |
        1. Pre-certifications - Achieve SOC2 Type II before first customer signature (Month 3-4)
           Cost: $15-25K audit fee (invest early)
           Benefit: Removes single largest regulatory blocker
        2. Legal Pre-Work - Engage finance-focused law firm (Cooley, WilmerHale)
           Cost: $5-10K retainer (Month 1)
           Benefit: Pre-drafted agreements, 4-8 week negotiation becomes 2-3 weeks
        3. Chief Compliance Officer (part-time advisor) - $2-5K/month retainer
           Timeline: Months 1-2
           Benefit: Internal + customer regulatory review speeds up
        4. Pilot + Formal Contract Separation - Simple NDA for POC (no compliance review), formal contract negotiations separate
           Timeline: Pilot weeks 1-4, Formal contract weeks 5-24 (parallel, not sequential)
        5. Expected acceleration: First contract Month 12 (no mitigation) → Month 6-9 (with mitigation)
    
    - risk: "Founder Burnout (10 hrs/week is sustainable but high stress in early stage)"
      impact: "Quality of customer acquisition suffers, missed pipeline development, potential founder health crisis"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: |
        1. Find co-founder early (Month 1-2) - Ideally with complementary domain (operations, compliance, tech)
           Benefit: Split workload, accelerate capability building
        2. Limit demo capacity to 5-8/month - Enforce boundaries to prevent burnout
        3. Delegate administrative tasks - Hire part-time ops person ($500-1K/month) to handle CRM, contracts, scheduling
        4. Time-bound commitment - Clarify 18-month commitment window before burnout timeline
    
    - risk: "Data Cost Overruns ($600K+ annually for market data limits profitability)"
      impact: "Gross margin drops from 75% → 40%, threatens unit economics"
      severity: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: |
        1. Negotiate Intrinio pricing - Leverage volume (growing customer base)
           Target: $600K/year → $300-400K/year by Year 2
        2. Use Polygon.io API (lower cost alternative) for basic data
           Cost: $250/month vs $2K+/month for premium
           Feature trade-off: Acceptable for SMB tier
        3. Freemium data tier - Offer limited real-time data on free tier (1-hour delayed)
           Benefit: Reduces data costs for free users
        4. Partner with data providers - Revenue share with Intrinio, Polygon (30-40% margin pass-through)
    
    - risk: "Competitive Pressure from TradingView (free), Trade Ideas (AI automation), Koyfin (fundamental data)"
      impact: "Harder to differentiate, lower willingness to pay, longer sales cycles"
      severity: "LOW-MEDIUM"
      mitigation: |
        1. Focus on SMB Niche (not enterprise) - Avoid direct competition with TradingView's consumer scale
        2. Differentiate on Team Collaboration - Bundle team alerts, shared dashboards (Koyfin, Trade Ideas lack this)
        3. Emphasize Cost Savings - "Replace $300K Bloomberg setup with $30K platform" messaging
        4. Speed-to-value - 4-week POC vs 12-week implementation (vs competitors)
  
  critical_success_factors:
    - factor: "Founder Domain Experience"
      requirement: "5+ years finance/trading experience OR 3+ years fintech ops background"
      consequence: "Without credibility, LTV:CAC ratio drops from 9:1 to 3:1, sales cycle extends to 18+ months"
      recommendation: "If missing, recruit co-founder BEFORE customer outreach"
    
    - factor: "SOC2 Type II Certification"
      requirement: "Achieve by Month 4 of operation (before first major customer conversation)"
      cost: "$15-25K audit fee"
      consequence: "Without SOC2, hedge fund CIOs will not engage (compliance blocker)"
      recommendation: "Start audit process in Month 1, prioritize this over feature development"
    
    - factor: "First Customer Close Timeline"
      requirement: "Close first paying customer by Month 9-12 (via pilot or advisory engagement)"
      consequence: "Miss this window → funding runway jeopardized, team morale at risk"
      recommendation: "Pilot program ($0-5K) to accelerate to Month 6-9"
    
    - factor: "Implementation Playbook Standardization"
      requirement: "By Customer 4-5, reduce implementation cost from $40-50K → $10-15K"
      consequence: "Without standardization, NRR < 100%, expansion revenue impossible"
      recommendation: "Document playbooks during Customer 1-3 implementations, systematize for Customer 4+"
  
  final_verdict: "PASS"
  verdict_reasoning: "Business is GTM-ready with Founder-Led Sales model. All critical criteria met: CAC payback = 4 months (excellent), LTV:CAC = 9:1 (3x benchmark), first customer path viable via pilot + advisor referrals. Long sales cycle (9-12 mo) is an asset for high-ACV positioning, not a liability. Regulatory complexity requires founder domain credibility (non-negotiable success factor). Recommend proceed with $15-25K pre-work investment (SOC2, legal, CCO advisor) before customer outreach."
